And, 'Immigration Daze' was a huge success says Maite Junco, the one who helped Fanina cook up this scheme. ""Their kids brought 'em, and we got 'em!

According to Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn, Stein, who has been a regular legal busy body, lately, asked to approach the bench, and the motion was sustained.

The Judge was not amused and ordered the bailiff to arrest Ms. Stein and then ruled that there would be no recount. Stein was led out of the courtroom, crying and in cuffs. Judge Bailey-Rihn then proceeded to explain to the courtroom about Pizzagate, and how she believed Hilary Clinton was a possible pedophile and a Reptilian shape shifter (citing David Ickes work, and the many Youtube videos on the subject) and would never get a recount in her jurisdiction, as long as she sat on the bench. Ms. Clinton could not be reached for comment. Baily-Rihn told us that there was most likely fraud in the election, and count, but since both sides do it, it works out to be mostly fair, in the end.

The lack of expressing sadness or happiness is turning humans into a catatonic robot-like state and Facebook cares about its users and wants to begin helping people express themselves again without the crutch of emoji's."

"Like Bieber via 2012’s Believe, Slow Hands reintroduced Horan to his fans as an adult. But where Zayn used shock tactics to differentiate himself from his past, Niall borrowed from the pages of Bieber’s book, and used his songwriting to prove he wasn’t just some dude with an acoustic guitar. He could sing well, he could creatively adapt for a grown-up solo venture, and he still cherished his existing fan base and the legacy of his former self. Which Justin did, once upon a time, too: while Bieber leapt from child prodigy to rebel without a cause, his musical evolution never really faltered, and his career was kept afloat by the legacy he refused to condemn or distance himself from. So if Niall considers himself another Bieber, that would be brilliant: he would arguably be setting himself up for even bigger and better success, fortunately too old to relive Justin’s 2013 ventures."

Canadians fear that Trumps comments could effect future relations between the two nations."
"Perhaps more than any other celebrity, Ms. Jolie, 42, has kept herself firmly planted in two vastly different worlds. She’s both the glamorous A-lister whose every move is tracked in headlines (“Angie and the kids left Target because it didn’t serve hot dogs,” read one recent newsflash), and the humanitarian do-gooder who has made more than 60 trips to the field as part of her United Nations work. Apparent contradictions account for her elusive allure. Ms. Jolie has been enduringly hard to peg, a woman who cannot easily be lumped into a single category because she occupies many at once."

"February saw airlines receiving some 100 aircraft and order another 43 for future delivery.  The airlines have shown a preference for short-haul airliners with one aisle.  These aircraft use fuel efficient engines and because of their smaller size usually fly with few empty seats making them profitable to operate.  Companies profiting from this trend include Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Comac, and Irkut to name a few.  Airbus conducts both research and development and some manufacturing in the UK.  It has some 15,000 employees in the UK manufacturing wings for its aircraft. The company pumps about £2bn annually into the UK economy.   How Brexit will affect manufacturing Airbus wings in the UK and shipping them to France for final assembly remains an open question.  For now, Airbus and the UK are ignoring that future turbulence and concentrating on positive income flows."

"There's a fine line between creative risk-taking and sacrilege when dealing with well-known properties. While ""Bates Motel"" might not have committed the latter  it has seemingly sacrificed the right to bill itself as a prequel to ""Psycho."" The A&E series always appeared to come with a built-in expiration date  facing the danger of running out of real estate as it chewed through story related to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror classic. The contemporary setting also made the proceedings less spooky  what with cellphones and other modern devices that alter the dynamics of  say  being alone in the basement with a murderer dressed like his mom. Still  the announcement of a fifth and final season that would overlap with the movie actually created some excitement: after an ill-advised remake  this offered an alternate window into the story  including how these events unfolded from the perspective of Norman/Norma Bates."

"When the new trailer for ""Justice League"" appeared Saturday, most fans, and even casual viewers alike, noted the obvious lack of the iconic Superman. Most felt that the ""Justice League"" was not complete, or even valid, without Henry Cavill's Superman (who, as expected from his absence, does not have a credit for this movie on IMDB). While Clark Kent's love interest, Lois Lane, was featured in the trailer, as portrayed by Amy Adams, he will not actually appear himself. At the end of Dawn of Justice, if you watched the teaser, dirt could be found floating above Superman's grave, indicating that he may actually be dead for good - with the scene being director Zack Snyder's method of assuring fans he won't be returning.   Snyder doesn't regret killing the character, off, however, he empathized with fans that thought that ""It's hard to have a 'Justice League' without Superman'. Snyder thought the movie provided a great way to demonstrate the weight of sacrifice in a way that the impacts of that sacrifice are truly felt. Not only did Superman sacrifice himself, he also removed himself from saving more lives in the future - that is something that has to be considered. So while the team may respect that he gave his life, they may also harbor anxieties about how they are going to face universal threats without him. ""It's an interesting dynamic"", Snyder muses, ""But I think audiences will be very interested."""
