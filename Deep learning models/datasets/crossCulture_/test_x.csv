 The death penalty makes us all murderers. If it is wrong for a criminal to kill, surely it is wrong for twelve respectable citizens to vote to kill, and for a variety of guards and wardens to participate in the killing. To be consistent, we must all be against killing, especially cold blooded heartless killing done with a sense of righteousness and justice. that is why I will argue against killing, and always pity those killed. all life is sacred, not just life that knows itself to be "good."
 I think that the death penalty shouldn't be legal.  I do however believe that in some cases people do deserve to die, however I don't think that this decision should ever be made by a court of law.  The main reason I don't think so is the simple fact that we may be wrong.  It not worth the risk of killing 10 truely bad guys if you accidently kill one innocent guy.  So basically I don't think the risk is worth the outcome.
 The death penalty really isn't a punishment.  It's a way the victims of a crime can get revenge for something that happened, but death is basically an end to any suffering the criminal might endure.  Personally, I feel it's barbaric.  I've never known anyone who was killed, and I've never had to watch someone die due to the death penalty, so I'm not sure how much weight my opinion should have.  At the same time, I can't imagine it doing the victims any more "good" than undergoing counseling.
 Our families are not safe.  People are murdered on the streets; Homes are being invaded; Gangs are controlling entire neighbourhoods.  Our judicial system needs the death penalty as a strong deterrent to this out of control violence.  The death penalty has been used in every part of the world for thousands of years and has not been found to be immoral or unjust.  We need to keep the death penalty and use it more often to protect our families and our country.
 I believe that abortion is wrong because a fetus is a living breathing human being.  It is no different then committing murder.  Upon conception, everyone has the right to be born.  Every women should be responsible enough to not engage in sexual activity or take responsibility for what might happen.
 He's a decent guy. He's understanding. He's worked hard after his stroke. He loves his wife.
 Abortion is a good thing. For one, the baby in my opinion is not a human being the first several months. The baby does not have a conscious at this point, therefore we can decide if we want to kill it or not. It is unborn and therefore not a human. It is okay.
 I feel the death penalty is a mistake and amoral. The death penalty does not take into account the idea of the greatest human weakness when it comes to that fact that mistakes are made. At different points there will always be mistakes made as this is just the logical conclusion you must arrive at whenever you explore the idea of trying hundreds of thousands of cases and all the variables that are in place. I just think it is silly for people to think they are not going to make mistakes and even get things sometimes outright wrong! So when you are talking about a human beings life you just cannot have this level of error of even on the tiniest level. We are talking about someone's whole life here. Once you take it you cannot come back and say I am sorry we were just wrong on this. It is just too late and you cannot correct that mistake once you put the death penalty in action.
 I believe the death penalty should never be an option for criminal punishment. It goes against my religious beliefs to condemn anyone to death, and I think supporting the death penalty is making oneself accessory to murder. The proper punishment for violent criminals should be rehabilitation, and if this fails imprisonment should be the last option to maintain public safety. The death penalty is never appropriate. The death penalty serves no purpose and destroys human compassion.
 every women should have the right to an abortion, given the volume of situations that are in such a grey area. like what if a molested child becomes pregnant? or a rape victim so traumatized she couldn't possibly keep the child? its a choice i strongly back, i love children, i have a daughter of my own but in america nobody should decide for you.
 The death penalty is painless all the time. The death penalty does no harm and is quick. The death penalty does not cost much to administer. The death penalty is always a 50/50 chance at life.
 I believe abortion should be illegal because the unborn child is a living person. The child does not have the right to make a decision if it wants to be here or not and what gives anyone else that right.I believe that a person should be held accountable for a child if they get pregnant becuase they made the choice to have sex.
 Hello all and thank you for coming. i would like to briefly talk about the subject of abortion.  I think we can all agree the topic is a heavy one and no one, on either side of opposing views, takes this topic lightly.  That being said, I think it is important to value the miracle of life.  I think as a society we should value life to the extent that the moment each life begins in the womb, it deserves a chance.  Our parents chose life and I think we should think about this as we each decide what is right.
 I don't believe abortion is wrong. The fetus in the womb is not a human being. It is not really a baby or person after conception. It is similar to a fish living in water. It is only a mass of cells that could turn into a human being later on at birth. Since this mass of cells is not human and is not a person, there is no morality involved in the destruction of it. Therefore, a woman has the power to choose what her body does. If she doesn't want to be pregnant, she can abort the fetus. It is her decision to have an unwanted pregnancy terminated.
 I don't believe the term pro-life and pro-choice are accurate descriptions to label either side of the party. I am both pro-life and pro-choice. I believe in life and I think that a baby is a human, I also believe however that there are circumstances that are beyond our control.  I think that sometimes abortion is the only viable option.  I believe that the government shouldn't have the right to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her body.
 He is really clever and I enjoy talking to him. He's never aggravating. He's always kind to the people around him. I love spending time with him because he is a people person.
 Abortion is at the core of what people consider an at a free will to do with ones own body whatever it is they would like to do.  I strongly believe in free will and feel that the freedom of choice is lumped right in there with it.  Who has the right what I or any other person to do to their own body.  If that begins, where will it end. Abortion is a well thought out concept that allows one to consider the possibilities of what life they can life and provide for a child they might not want.  Is it fair to bring a child into a world were it could possibly be unloved and unwanted by its parents.  How is that any better of a life?
 I believe abortion is wrong because it is the taking of a human life.  We all started out the same way, a sperm joined to an egg, multiplication of cells, continued growth and development until we became who we are today.  A baby grows in it's mother's womb, but it is it's own being with it's own organs, nerves, and as science continues to develop, we know the baby even has its own thoughts and feelings. If we lower the standard for life to only include those who can survive independently of another, we are on a slippery slope to saying many already here are not entitled to life, including severely malformed and retarded, and chronically ill and elderly who may depend on machines for food and oxygen. I believe life starts at conception and we should respect life in all its forms.
 I don't believe anyone, nor any court has the right to dictate whether someone lives or dies for a punishment. Life in prison is harsh enough. Taking a life should not be justified under any circumstances.
 Abortion is murder and people who kill others should be put to death. It goes against the teachings of the Bible and is the worst kind of sin. We should do everything to stop it, no matter the cost. People should be ashamed for even thinking about having an abortion.
 I believe the death penalty should be allowed.  Capital punishment is a necessity for criminal deterrence.  If someone is mental sick enough to take someone else's life then they are the ultimate threat to society and therefore deserve the ultimate punishment.  If we don't set an example, then other criminals will not be deterred.
 Every person born has, in this day and age, the chance at an education and to find his/her way in the world. We have problems that need to be solved and we will have further problems in the future. We need youth and young people with their new perspectives to offer solutions to the world. When we abort a pregnancy we interfere with our future population, possibly ruining our chances at a new member of society who can help and contribute to a better future. Rather than have too many pregnancies and therefore the need for abortion, we should practice abstinence and have sex only when we want children. This will make abortion unnecessary and allow us to serve the future. We should continue harsh penalties for crimes such as rape to deter these crimes, which are actually very few when you look at real statistics.
 Abortion should be outlawed completely because it is an abomination in they eyes of man and the Lord.In reality it is murder in every sense of the word and should be punishable by the law
 I think we should get rid of the death penalty. It is expensive and life in prison without the chance for parole is a lot better punishment than executing what may be an innocent man or woman. The death penalty is archaic and out dated. Plus most judges have struck it down as cruel and unusual punishment. Death Row should be a thing of the past.
 The death penalty is a severe but necessary punishment for the worst criminals in our society. It is the ultimate price, and those who would transgress against our laws must know that justice and retribution will come for the crimes they have committed. It is far cheaper to the taxpayer, and safer for society at large, to kill people that are that evil and dangerous. Imposing a death sentence also serves to give a measure of peace to the families of victims. Some people are monsters and just should not be on this earth.
 We must question everything the government does, and capital punishment is no exception. Perhaps one of the most important, yet less obvious questions we must ask about a government action, the death penalty included, is how does it benefit society? Will it contribute more to this country than the alternatives? And the answer is no. Study after study has shown that capital punishment is (1) more expensive than life in prison with parole, (2) it is not a deterrent, and (3) that the courts have made countless errors in death penalty cases. Considering that it is more costly and is not a deterrent (and therefore serves virtually no function than to carry out retribution, another word for revenge--one of the most primitive and low emotions), it does not contribute more to society than the alternatives. And considering that hundreds of people have been sentenced to death, only to be later exonerated by DNA evidence, the use of capital punishment is not acceptable, as there is no room for error when talking about a person's life.
 The death penalty is needed in our current criminal system. We spend thousands of dollars housing criminals which could go to the education of children and reduction of crime. Ultimately some people are not redeemable and should be killed for their crimes. It is clear that the death penalty should be reinstated as those criminals who have committed egregious crimes on our society should not burden it further.
 I believe that abortion is wrong because it takes away a human life. Abortion is not just about the mother's choice - it takes away any choice the baby had in it's life. To choose abortion is to choose your own happiness over the very life of another human being. It is selfish at its core, and it is sad that in our country, it is acceptable to be so selfish that you actually kill another person in order to preserve your own comfort and standard of living. It is hard to raise a child, but life is hard, and is it really OK to say, "Oh, I don't want to have a baby right now. It's not the right time for me." and then kill it?
 Abortion is murder. A fertilized egg immediately becomes a person whose rights need to be protected. It is unconscionable to allow millions of babies to be murdered for the convenience of a woman who was not responsible enough to use birth control. There are many loving homes to send the unwanted children to.
 Americans are wasting precious tax dollars keeping heinous criminals locked up alive, when we could put them to death and make room and save money. if someone receives such a harsh sentence, usually its just. it would make Americans a lot more sensitive to their actions
 Firstly, the real issues here is life . Which to my best of knowledge that's been taught to me by my schooling is to respect the value of living . The art of living is just sensible enough to comprehend the meaning of life. By and large, with the teaching of the church of Christianiy no doubt that life is a must to uphold and behold. The Abortion issues is truly a disgusting concept to my best of understanding for it goes against the grain of all the doctrines of wisdom of man since the memorial times of existence.
 Whenever I work with my friend Juan, he always has my back. If it gets busy he helps me out. If my boss gets pissed at me then Juan defends me. He gives me rides home and we smoke together.
 Abortion in my eyes is completely okay, I'm pro-choice. The clinics have allotted times you are allowed to get an abortion because before then the fetus is not yet a functioning baby. Therefore you're not hurting anyone or anything by having it removed. Everyone has a right to pick and choose which path they lead in life and for some people having children is not what they choose.
 I believe that life begin at conception and that human life is sacred.  My views are based on my study of the Bible,which I believe is inspired of God.  God's word teaches that an unborn child, regardless of its age, is a human being. I strongly believe that abortion is murder and that an unborn child has every right to live, regardless of the circumstances under which it was conceived. Saying that a woman has the right to abort her child is like saying that we all have the right to kill our neighbor.
 Every life is precious, from the moment of conception. When abortions occur, the mother is basically killing the child. God would not approve of abortion. Abortions cause mental anguish on the mother after the procedure. The actual abortion is a horrific act where the fetus is ripped from the mother's womb. How could anyone do that to their child?
 Abortion should be a human right. Every woman should have the right to choose what happens in and to her body. If she was capable enough top make the decision to have sex and become pregnant, then she should be able to terminate that pregnancy if she chooses. A woman should not be forced to endure something that she does not want and a baby can be a lifelong burden.
 Choosing to take the life of any being is wrong. We have no right to decide the value of life nor to take away the possibility of redemption in any form. There is always the possibility that the person could be wrongly convicted of a crime, and if their life was taken that would constitute a grievous murderous act.  Facilities are adequate to safe guard the person from ever returning to do harm thus negating the need to take a life. If the person is correctly convicted he is not adequately punished by offering death as a way out either. The crime ends with the incarceration and then the punishment of time living with the loss of freedom and the knowledge of what that person has done should be the way that we deal humanely with our criminal population.  The death penalty only brings more death.
 The death penalty doesn't teach a criminal a lesson, because if they are killed they are no longer alive to learn from it. It also does not seem to be very convincing to other criminals, our murder rates are at a high even with the death penalty in place. If thou shall not kill, we are being hypocritical by telling the murderer he is wrong but we are also going to murder him or her. If it does not dissuade, then it serves no purpose. Being sentenced to prison for life is actually worse punishment, as that person will have to live with what they have done every day, and also suffer attacks from other prisoners, especially child molesters and killers.
 I believe abortion is killing a human being. The physical life of a distinct human individual begins at conception, and all through the pregnancy this human being is formed, growing, and changing in the womb. God is the creator of human life. No matter what the circumstances, at conception an actual living person is created. In God's eyes, the killing of this person in the womb is sin. It is murder. Most of the time a woman aborts a baby because she doesn't want to live with the consequences of her choice to have intercourse. Babies are a natural result of having intercourse.
 I don t agree with death penalty. Death no doubt is a final penalty to a person to his crime. But is that the most severe one? Definitely no. We should use other penalty to either let them pay their guilty. But also make value to the society
 The death penalty should never be used because there is always a chance we may kill someone who is innocent.  Even one life taken from an innocent citizen is too much to allow this process to take place.  It has been shown through DNA evidence that several executions took place on innocent people.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  Please join with me to prevent these horrible crimes against innocent citizens to happen again.
 All life is sacred.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  Even if someone did something horrible, they shouldn't have to die.  They're still a human being and deserve to be treated like one.
 I am absolutely pro-life.  I think that all babies have the right to live, and it shouldn't matter what the mother's circumstances are.  It is legally and morally wrong to kill an innocent child.  That child was a child the moment it was conceived.  Both birth control and plan b are running our nation and killing our next generation.
 Abortion should not be an acceptable practice, ever. Precluding the life of an unborn child is dominating and nullifying their inalienable right to live. Regardless of the circumstances, the baby ought to be considered first, not the context of the pregnancy. Even the impregnated rape victim ought to follow through with the pregnancy to allow the child life. What would they say if they had a voice in the matter?
 Abortion is about not only the fetus but the mother to be as well. Women who are raped or suffer from incest may be forced to have unwanted and ill children against their will. The procedure needs to be anonymous and without incident to keep privacy in check. It is not for a man or even another woman to decide for each person.
 Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. Mistakes do happen and people have sex. One of the unintended/unwanted outcomes of having sex is the possibility of becoming pregnant. There are a lot of situations where this is not ideal - single motherhood, poverty. Why would anyone want to raise a child in those conditions? It is a burden on the taxpayer as the individual who had the child when they weren't ready will have to depend on taxpayers for assistance. I don't think I should have to pay higher taxes so people can have children. This is why abortion should be legal. I think there should be restrictions, like a pregnancy can be terminated at most when the woman is three months in. The fetus is not viable/cannot live outside the mother at this point.
 Have the same interests. Get along very well. There for each other. Can trust implicitly.
 i dont support the idea of death penalty on the basis that its an easy way out for the offender. if you end the life of the offender what has he suffered, nothing. but the family who is affected by the crime of the offended who forever feel the pain of what he has done. i believe that they offender should be kept alive to suffer and be kept in the most unbearable of places so he would regret all the remaining days of hi life what he has done and would want to end his own life himself
 The death penalty is necessary because it deters some of the most serious crimes. If people fear the death penalty, they will be less likely to commit terrible crimes.  If our only punishment is to lock them away in a jail, it is not enough of a deterrent.  If someone takes the life of someone else, their life should be taken from them.
 I don't believe in the death penalty because religion teaches us that it is morally wrong to execute someone no matter the circumstance. Everyone has the capacity to change and rehabilitate but we won't ever get the chance to see it if there is a death penalty.
 I believe abortion should be ruled as legal in every state and every country in the world. Abortion is a human right for a woman to choose what to do with her body. It takes up a variety of factors such as economic and social situations and I believe it is important that women at least have the ability to make a decision that is all their own rather than having some outside party or political measure make the choice for them. Each woman should have the right to her own individual decision regardless of the environment she lives in. Banning abortion could have detrimental effects on both the lives of the pregnant woman and those closest to her.
 I believe that the death penalty is justified and fair.  Criminals who are on death row have obviously committed heinous crimes.  Keeping such criminals alive with a life sentence is a waste of tax payer's money.  The death penalty ensures that such criminals are eliminated from society.  I am sure that executing a prisoner is much cheaper than keeping them alive.  We as tax payers should not give up a chunk of our hard earned money just to keep criminal scum alive.
 A baby is a human at the moment of conception. There was a Pennsylvania abortionist who was charged with killing babies that were born alive, but he killed them by severing their spinal cords or slitting their necks. If abortion is legal then a lot of abortions are done as a matter of convenience. If women would take care of protecting themselves and we made that more of a priority unwanted pregnancies would significantly reduce.
 I'd like to believe the people are good and all should be given mercy, that we the people are better than to take an eye for an eye. But sometimes those who do not respect life and have/are willing to take it should not have it. Life it the greasiest thing in the world and taking it from somebody is wrong but taking it away from the bad people may in a small way be justice even thought it doesn't bring our loved ones back. Sometimes to keep the peace mercy can not be given eve if we want believe it is the right thing to do.
 The death penalty is an outdated, ineffective, and expensive means of punishment that should be completely banned in the United States. Almost every other developed country in the western world has banned the death penalty, so why is the US still living in the past? The death penalty is archaic and it promotes a vicious cycle of responding to violence with violence. Even with the death penalty, violence in the US is sky high. Also, if killing is so bad, then it should be bad even when it comes to killing others who have committed horrible crimes. I have heard it costs more to carry out a death penalty than to give someone life in prison so it is ineffective in that way as well.
 she is my girlfriend too. she can be alittle annoying and dumb at times. i love her regardless though. it is annoying when she asks my help with every little thing. i know she can do it herself. i am busy or it would not be a problem. i love her with all my heart though.
 If we are saying that we are punishing people for committing horrible crimes by putting them to death then we can't justify that by doing the exact same thing. We are not Gods and we do not have the right to say if someone lives or dies, this makes us murders just the same as the person we are punishing. It is not up to us to say someone's life is without meaning or purpose. It is not up to us to say someone's life is over and they have no more time on this earth. We cannot continue to preach that hurting and killing people is against the law unless we do it, that it hypocrisy at its finest.
 I agree with the death penalty if there is 100% proof that the defendant did the crime. I also think we are too easy with the way we put these killers to death, I believe they should be punished just as they did with their victims. The only problem I have is that there have been cases where an innocent person has been put to death and that is why I believe there needs to be definitive proof, such as admission, video tape, reliable witnesses or DNA that can not be refuted. If it seems that a person who is being executed suffered at all, the family or anyone should not be able to sue the state or anyone else by a matter of law.
 I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and on demand.  It should only be up to the woman carrying the fetus to decide whether she wants to continue carrying it.  Any other choice would constitute slavery, by forcing the woman to continue carrying the fetus, and would be a removal of her agency.  She should be able to have an abortion at any time, even if she's nine months along.  However, I do not think this is a wise choice, but it should be an option, nonetheless.   I believe that facilities should be readily available, with educated doctors and counselors to help the woman make the absolute best choice for her and her life.  These facilities, ideally, would be inexpensive, or have means of helping her pay for her abortion.
 Abortion is wrong no matter what. It is murder of a human life, no exceptions. People who do it are disgusting whores who clearly don't believe in god and will spend eternity in hell.  If you dont want to be pregnant dont have sex, or use protection.  That way you wont have to be a murderer.
 Abortion is permissible. Every woman has the right to choose to get an abortion. This is because it is her body and an unborn child is not the equivalent of a fully mature person. The decision to get an abortion is deeply personal and can not be legislated.
 I don't support the death penalty because I don't believe the state should be given the power to kill citizens. It sets a dangerous principle. Not only that, but I also don't trust the state not to murder innocent people, as has happened in the past. To be honest, in principle I do believe there are some crimes that are deserving of death, but I don't support giving the state the right to carry out the death penalty.
 Forcing women to have children they do not want places a burden both on the mother and on society.  There are far too many instances of children being born to 'parents' who consider them a 'mistake' after having unprotected sex.  Society cannot continue to provide unlimited care for these unwanted children.  It's like saying "Just because I ate that cake, I don't want those extra pounds."  It was your choice, sweetheart, live with it.
 Abortion is not moral.   It should not be legal.  Woman who have abortions are killing babies.  Governments who allow abortion are allowing murder.
 I believe that the death penalty is necessary for our current society. Society as a whole has degraded so much that death penalty is required. We need it to punish and deter future criminals. This will also serve as a good tool for population control as the Earth is rapidly becoming over populated.
 I have been friends with my best friend since we were 14. We have been in and out of each others lives since. We always pick right back up where we left off. We understand each other and have the best stories. Even our kids are good friends and go to the same schools.
 My best friend is also my boyfriend. I feel like most of the time I can tell him anything. I can say exactly what I feel to him (within reason) and I won't feel guilty for having my opinion. I don't feel anxious or like I'm hiding my feelings around him. I can be myself and he can be himself around me. Whenever we have a fight we always work it out because we don't want to cast resentment. We stay together because we communicate well, care about each other and want to be with each other as long as possible.
 The death penalty legally serves as a way for justice to be served. There are plenty of crimes people commit that involves the loss of others lives we can't get back. The penalty also stands as a threat to show criminals that you can also be murdered for murdering. Enforcement of this penalty should live in the minds of wrongful people.
 Although abortion has been practiced throughout history, much of it was due to the low regard for women's health.  Permitting a pregnancy to run its course should be as acceptable as making a baby in the first place.  Yes, there will be women who look upon having a baby as a step back from the progress women have been making overall, but I believe that if two people decide to have sex, they should welcome the potential consequences, not suck it out with a vacuum.  Of course, rape and the health of the mother are the two reasons why abortions should be performed, but they should not be performed if the resulting child interferes with the lifestyle of the mother.  No one asked the child to be conceived; no one asks it if it wishes to be born.
 A baby should not be punished for a woman's mistakes. At the end of the day, abortion is the murder of an innocent baby. How can anybody allow that to take place? It's disgusting and nothing short of murder. If the woman doesn't want to raise her child, there's always the option of adoption.
 The death penalty, or capital punishment, is a barbaric and uncertain method to deal with criminals. There are too many cases that have been reopened and reexamined where new evidence exonerated people that have been on death row for years or decades. Because forensics and other investigation methods cannot be 100 percent sure of a result, there is no way to determine 100 percent that a person is guilty so applying a 100 percent punishment is overboard. We also cannot guarantee that the methods used for capital punishment are humane and pain free. There are many reports of death penalty sentences being carried out where the subject is suffering for long periods of time before expiring. The death penalty also violates the basic right that nobody should be subject to cruel and unusual punishment.
 Abortion is morally wrong and should not be allowed in any circumstance.  Life begins from conception and every being deserves a chance at life.  We should not say that some people should not have a right to life.  Every living thing can feel pain and so it's wrong to subject a living being to pain when they are innocent.
 My best friend is great because we enjoy the same things. We also went to school together for the better part of the year and still keep in contact. He also found things to do all the time so we weren't bored. We plan on having a get together every year with some other friends because we are awesome people.
 The death penalty is always wrong.  There is never room for the death penalty.  To uphold the death penalty is just as bad as murder itself.  Jail is the ultimate punishment because they have to live with their decision.  As long as jail keeps them locked up and alive, they are in hell.
 He is very persistent.
 It is alright to abort an unborn fetus.  It isn't really alive or a human being at this point.  You should abort if you can't support or feel you can't raise a child.  God understands and He would want you to be comfortable with abortion.
 My basic belief is that it is always wrong to take another life.  So the death penalty would go against everything I believe in.  However, if someone killed someone close to me, I am not sure how I would feel about the death penalty.  Life in prison without parole may be a harsher punishment than death.
 We like to go to the movies together and shopping. We hang out all the time and talk on the phone. We are similar personalities and enjoy eachother's company. I can really rely on this person for help.
 I believe that abortion is an acceptable practice. There have been instances of rape that caused impregnation, and these instances left the victim in the dilemma of carrying a child that is the result of a horrible crime. Since I believe that there is sound reasoning in accepting abortion at this juncture, this decision ought to be left to the discretion of the woman carrying the child. Whenever a woman becomes pregnant, she ought to have control over the destiny of her child.
 I believe that people should be able to decide who is in their body when, at all times. There should be absolutely no restrictions on ending a pregnancy - noting that 'ending a pregnancy' does also include birthing a live child. You are never obligated to give up your body or your bodily products to anyone, including a fetus. You get to decide if that fetus can keep leeching your nutrients and blood and doing irreparable damage to your body, you get to decide whether or not to donate your blood, marrow, or kidney's to your dying relatives, you get to decide whether people get to have your organs when you are dead and not using them anymore or even aware of what is happening to them. Bodily autonomy is a cornerstone of freedom itself, and without it you lose the justification for criminalizing any and all interpersonal violence.
 I believe that god thinks its wrong to have an abortion. The woman should not have the right to kill the child. I believe with fully certainty that the child is alive and a person and that killing it is murder. A woman shouldn't have the right to have an abortion in cases of rape or incest and the government should step in and banned women's rights to have abortions.
 There are some people in our society who do not belong in it.  They made that choice, but they don't think they should have to live with it...or die by it.  Wrong, my friend: You decided to unleash your hatred of the good people of our society by doing your heinous crime and now you must pay the price by giving up your right to live.  I'm not saying we have to dance in the streets when a criminal is executed, but we have to be loud and clear that they are responsible for their actions and must accept the consequences.  Without just rules governing societal behavior, we will descend into anarchy, chaos, and the collapse of civilization.  I didn't yip and yap with pleasure when Bin Laden was killed, but I certainly did not mourn his passing.  I feel the same about murderers and rapists..there is no room in society for these foul criminals.
 The baby still has a heartbeat.  YOu could give birth to the kid and give it to a family that would love it.  Why would you not give something even a chance to live?
 Abortion is morally wrong and should be prohibited by law. Unborn fetuses should be treated like fully born humans and given the resulting rights under law. Fetuses possess unique genetic material that comes from both parents and should therefore be given personhood under law. Abortion is medically unsafe, risky, and unnecessary. Individuals who can not afford to support their children should give them up for adoption.
 I believe that regardless of what horrendous acts an individual performs, he or she is deserving of life. I don't think that the death penalty is justified because lots of prosecutional techniques aren't 100% accurate. Lots of innocent people have been put to their deaths, only to have the evidence be reexamined and the verdict overturned. If a system can't accurately and undisputably implicate an individual then capital punishment should not be enforced.
 The death penalty is a very problematic and controversial act in the United States. However I believe that the death penalty should be legal in the United States because tax payers are paying so much money to just provide for these inmates who should just die instead. They are spending tax payers money for their health rather on other essential things such as healthcare. Which is why the death penalty is a good thing and should be acted upon the criminals so that the economy  can become stable again.
 This person says the greatest things to keep me upbeat. They have this wonderful smile that lights up the room as if God himself has graced your presence. They know how to treat a friend when times get tough. They also have awesome fashion sense with multiple talents to back it up. Always lending an ear at any given moment.
 Fetuses have a right to live. If you can't accept the possibility of giving birth, you shouldn't have sex. Pregnancy is a gift, and you shouldn't be ungrateful and try to return it. Your body isn't -just- your own, it belongs to everyone, to god, to the human race. Think of how cute babies are, and everything else will fall into place.
 I believe the death penalty is a necessary evil in modern society. As I am not hindered by religious motivations about the sanctity of life, I have no reason to believe that the death penalty is morally wrong. I think that in cases of extreme violence or madness, death is the proper punishment when a person is a danger to the lives of other human beings. I believe the death penalty should be given to those who murder, and also support the death penalty in cases such as those of an extremely violent rapist or sexual predator. The death penalty serves its purpose when a criminal is truly beyond help or rehabilitation.
 The death penalty should be used as the court sees fit. I believe if a person does something that should get the death penalty then so be it. I feel killing someone, child rape, kidnapping, and any other horrid thing, then you should face the death penalty.
 If the death penalty were legalized, people could be sentenced to death for crimes that they did not necessarily commit. It has been shown many times that an innocent person has been sent to prison. In this case, the person can later be proven innocent and released from the facility, but the death penalty is a punishment that cannot be reversed.
 death penalty is right. an eye for an eye. if someone killed then why do you want to keep that person alive, i believe thats its right that the person be killed too so he suffers the same fate. if you decide to keep the person alive or in jail for a little period of time for her wrong doing then its tax payers people's money that shall be used to maintain him, i dont think thats right. kill him and be done with that chapter, also let the familyy of the offender know what it is to loose someone.
 I do not believe in the death penalty at all for any reason. I was raised in a christian home with a father who a pastor. We are to forgive a person for what they have done and let God be the judge of the person who did the crime. As of now I still do not believe in the death penalty.
 I believe abortion is morally wrong. Each child is a gift from God. If women choose to participate in sex then they must realize that one of the possible consequences is pregnancy. If we did not make it so easy for women to get an abortion, perhaps these women would be forced to make more responsible decisons. Many women who get abortions have had more than one. They use it as a form of birth control.
 I think that for certain crimes we should have the death penalty, for crimes such as murder or torture. Why should these people get to live their lives while the others, the ones who they killed or came close to don't get to? Why should their family have to deal with that pain?
 Abortions should be against the law no matter what the situation is.  There is a living child in the women from the minute of conception.  There is absolutely no circumstance in which abortion should be legal.  It is murder.
 I think is wrong to decided on someone life. Hkw could a bunch of people that seek justice believe in something like that.  If the first act was wrong and it's been punished by putting away the criminal how can a second act of death be right. No one should have a right to take someone life from the criminal to the state.
 I am not against abortion.  I am against the notion of killing human beings, and abortion falls under this spectrum.  If people don't want to have babies then they shouldn't be having sex.  Everyone knows how a baby is made and they should not be allowed to kill a living human being just because they screwed up.  Do we allow people to kill their accountant if he screws your taxes up?  A resounding no, and abortion is no different.
 Every action has consequences. Sometimes these consequences are good, and sometimes they are bad. These consequences are distributed in proportion to the action. Capital punishment is one of these consequences. It is reserved for the most heinous of crimes, always involving murder. By being a citizens of this country, you agree to follow the law. Everyone knows that when breaking the law, you will get punished. In this sense, capital punishment is not immoral; it is the pre-determined punishment for especially egregious crimes. If a murderer wants to keep his life, he should have considered this basic principle before committing the crime. There is no reason the worst criminals in this country should be exempt from the appropriate punishment.
 If a person killed another person they should always receive the death penalty.  An eye for an eye seems to fit in this case.  The death penalty may deter some people from killing another person.  However, a truly evil person probably wouldn't pay attention to that.
