 Abortion is actually almost where I think it should be, more or less widely and easily available and performed by medical professionals. However, the stigma and emotional weight that the decision carries prevents it from becoming frivolous. Ideally, we could maintain the immensity of the choice without the violence and judgement.
 God's will is that thou shall not kill.  I firmly believe that we are not meant to decide if a person is born or not.  Only God should decide who lives and dies.  Government is right to pass laws to stop abortion.
 Personally Iâ€™m somewhat against abortions beyond the third week of pregnancy, I believe that by this point the fetus is developed enough to be considered a human and have rights. If the fetus is a product of rape no restrictions to abortion should apply, as her pregnancy was not by choice.  I believe it would be perverse to force a woman to give birth to the child of her rapist. I believe my viewpoints are reasonable and show a levelheadedness not found often in abortion debates.
 Abortion should be illegal no matter the circumstances. you are killing children. All life is sacred. I'm a republican.
 killing another man is inhumane, an eye for an eye is an aged belief, we need to create other productive ways to deal with the humans are monstrosity's.
 I never have believed in this part of the system. Why should someone that has it in their blood to kill someone else, have to face the death penalty. I wouldn't care of about that person, never liked them. They thought they were too good, so I'm going after them, where they will not see daylight again. They won't act like they are too good for me. I say, set them free, and continue with the next.
 The death penalty is important because it acts as a deterrent. Criminals need to know that if the commit a severe enough crime, there's a chance the state will have them killed. The states that don't allow the death penalty are all bleeding-heart liberal states. Texas has the right idea.
 I believe the death penalty is good in certain cases such as serial killers, and bombers. I believe the death penalty provides a piece of mind for victims and families of victims. I believe the death penalty scares people into admitting their faults, which is good for confessions for trial. I believe the death penalty makes a way to simple have justice.
 I believe abortion is a choice that a woman must make for herself. No one should have control of a woman's body and what she should be allowed to do with it. If she can not afford to care for the child she is carrying then she should not have it and allow herself and the child to be a burden on an already weakened government system. Our government has control of many things, but what precedent will it set once the government is allowed to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her god given property. Will we then be faced with government sanctions on what we wear? Who we have sex with and how we are to have sex with them? There needs to be a limit to government control and it can start with allowing women to make choices for situations regarding abortion.
 Standing from the catholic point of view since i am a catholic i am agaisnt the whole idea of abortion. once a lady concieves life is formed inside of her. i dont see the reason why she would want to take that life from the poor creature. the bible says thou shall not kill and i believe everyone who pertakes of the whole aborting beat is guilty of the sin of murder and shall be punished. if abortion is continued to be encouraged it would lead to more teens having sex when they are not ready for it. if people know that abortion is not an option then they would steer clear of sex and that would also help keep the medical situation of the country safe as it means there would be less STDs out there.
 The death penalty is an inhumane way to deal with prisoners.  Although the crimes committed by these individuals range in severity such as serial raping, murder, and other atrocious crimes, the people who committed these are crimes are human.  These people should be given a life in prison, where they can be controlled and separated from society so they no longer are a threat, while we do not stoop to their level and take their lives from them.  By killing them, we are becoming what they are.  The death penalty has been used in the past, and innocent men have lost their lives due to this.
 I feel the death penalty should be used more often.  When someone kills another human being, they should be punished just as they punished the deceased.  If we do not take their lives, they have not learned a lesson.  They could also go out and kill someone else, and we must stop that at any cost.
 The death penalty in America is a more efficient method of dealing with unreformable violent offenders. Prisons cost taxpayers $32 billion dollars every year and it is estimated that it costs $1.5 million dollars per inmate to keep them alive in prison for life. This price will rise and only to keep violent and dangerous people in the world. And this only serves to tell offenders they will be cared for in a safe environment for the rest of their lives.
 I believe that abortion is wrong. Women who abort their child are murdering their children when they have the option to give a child to a person who would love to have a child. The Bible says that murder is wrong and I believe that abortion is murder. When a woman finds out she is pregnant she knows that at the end of 9 months she will have a living child and it is her job to take care of that child until the day she leaves the earth or the child leaves the earth.
 The death penalty is not a deterrent at all.  What it really is is a burden on taxpayers who pay for death row convicts to live out their lives in prison.  In addition, there have been so many convicts later proven innocent with updated technology such as DNA.  Man is not God; man makes mistakes, and having just one person wrongly killed under the death penalty is one too many.
 I stand for the death penalty. If you take a life than you should pay for it with your own life. I think people may think twice about harming other people if they had to pay that high of a price...a deterrant. Too much money is spent housing, feeding, etc prisioners. They're lives are better than others, no resposibilities, no work, plenty of free time, food, shelter.
 I am totally for the death penalty ! If you kill someone or brutally rape someone, you should fry for it ! "An eye for an eye" should be our motto in capital cases. Maybe then, people will think twice before they kill somebody.
 This law should be prohibited and all rights to such an action should be vanished. Life should not be something decided. There are very harsh situations such as mother or child in a surgery and a choice needs to be made. However I don't believe that women should just freely get rid of the "problem."
 I am pro abortion and firmly believe that every women has the right to make a choice. However, if a women has an abortion in the United States and cannot afford to pay for the abortion then the burden should not lie on the American tax payer. Instead, the women receiving the free abortion should be forced into signing an agreement with for example, Social Services to donate her time with charity work for a specified amount of hours, until the free money from the tax payer is paid off.  If abortions became illegal and these unwanted children were born it would put a strain on the American economy and cost tax payers! American tax payers are already burdened with the tax bill of providing food, shelter, health care cost etc. to these children.
 I believe that abortion should be allowed.  Everyone should have the choice whether or not they want to go through with a pregnancy and bring a child into this world.  People get pregnant unintentionally all the time, and at times in their lives when they are unable to properly provide for a child.  There is also the circumstance of a woman getting raped and becoming pregnant from it.  If they don't want to keep that baby, should they be forced to do so?  I think that it would be a reminder to one of the most traumatic experiences a human being can face.
 I believe that abortion is wrong, unless the mother's life is in danger or she was the victim of sexual assault.  I know several female friends that have had babies.  Many of these ladies post pics from their ultrasounds on facebook as well as share them by other means.  They refer to the pics as 'their baby'; give it a name; they even have listened to their unborn baby's heartbeat.  If something has a heartbeat then it must be living.  In short, I think ending a pregnancy (unless to save the mother's life) is wrong.
 What if the alleged offender seeked justice on a wrong doer, avenging. There have been self defense cases where one defended himself and received this harsh penalty. Why are those who judge the offenders get a watch someone die slow that never harmed them? Sometimes, this penalty is praised.
 The death penalty is vital for us to be able to teach that murder is wrong. Without it there is no real consequence from the murder of someone. In some cases the murderer can be released back into society which develops a mindset that you can get away with killing someone. This also gives the family and loved ones of the victim the sense that they can not trust in the judicial system. This sometimes results in people taking the law into their own hands resulting in more deaths and more lives being affected.
 The notion that innocent people are wrongfully killed because of the death penalty is vastly overblown. Criminal trials take too much time, money, and effort for a completely innocent person to be convicted time and time again. Just because someone says that they are innocent, doesn't make it so. A jury found them guilty for good cause, and people are often hesitant to hand out the death penalty. It's clear that there are times when a crime deserves a punishment like death, and any other punishment would be too easy. Having them rot in prison is just a drain of tax money. The death penalty deserves to stay.
 I really enjoy how his stories are always great, and funny. His laugh is contagious and everyone else enjoys being around him. He's a real ladies man and is a role model of sorts. Just an all around good guy that's fun to be around.
 The death penalty can be categorized as cruel and unusual punishment, banned by laws in modern society. So why should the option even exist. There are too many innocent men and women convicted of crimes in our broken justice system that may even be facing the death penalty themselves. How is that fair? I do not think we are at the necessary level we need to be as a society to be accepting of the death penalty. It has been around since man invented the justice system. Dont you think we would have evolved since the middle ages?
 If you kill another you deserve to die. The state should not have to pay for murders to live. The death penalty should be mandatory for murders. The period on death row should be shortened. The death penalty removes dangerous and violent criminals from society and jails. No one should be allowed to life for life in jail after taking life.
 I believe that the death penalty should be allowed. If the person has committed a crime which lead to the death of another, I believe that person should be considered for the death penalty. If the resulting death was in defense of something, or a vigilante killing, I think the person should have a more lenient punishment. Lastly, if the person has killed multiple people ON PURPOSE, I believe that the death penalty should be painful.
 I think that abortion should not be tolerated as an acceptable choice.  If someone is willing to have sex, they should be prepared to accept the consequences that go with it.  That is the choice they made, they should be responsible for it.  There is no reason that a potential life should be ceased so that they can avoid the results of their own actions.
 The death penalty should be forbidden. Too many people have been innocently executed due to faulty evidence. Moreover, It ceases any chance for rehabilitation. The person who is sentenced to death does not have the chance to right their wrongs. An eye for and eye makes the whole world blind.
 I am completely pro-life. To kill a baby in the womb is murder. Also it's against Gods will. whoever chooses to have an abortion will burn in hell.
 I disagree with the death penalty because of its cost on taxpayers and the fact that there is no way to undo a wrongful death.  The appeal processes for people on death row is incredibly expensive, more expensive than that of a life sentence, and since there are so many prisoners right now, we end up paying a ton more for death row appeals.  Also, once an inmate is killed, there is absolutely no way that that act can ever be reversed.  Once the (wo)man's dead, there's no return.  I find it disgusting that we still kill inmates in our supposed "land of the free" country.
 I believe abortion should be allowed for women who deserve to have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies. Taking away this right would be unconstitutional, especially for women who had no control over the circumstances in which they became pregnant. Those opposed to abortion, are typically conservatives who do not care about individuality. Abortion should remain an American right.
 recently, more and more states in the US implementing laws that suspend the death penalty for certain individuals. achieving a consensus of widespread prohibition of the death penalty is integral in keeping america free. most incidents of capital punishment are not constitutional because they constitute as "cruel and unusual punishment," thus violating the 8th amendment. it is better for convicts to serve a lengthier time than the be punished by death.
 The death penalty is a serious topic especially relating to criminals who committed serious offenses to the public. However, I am a Christian and I feel everyone should have the right to be forgiven for any sort of criminal act that have done. Which means that I believe that the death penalty should not be a legal thing. Instead criminals who may have committed serious crimes should just be put in jail rather than just killing them off.
 Abortion is completely wrong! It is murdering a human being, and whoever has an abortion is killing their baby. It doesnt matter if the woman was raped, the child should not be punished. If the mother dies or is physically hindered from the birth of the child, that is not more important than the life of a fetus.
 The death penalty is the better options cause it stops criminal from the get go. It saves the state a lot of money plus it shows justice fror the victims.  People who are sentences to death penalty should know that paying with their life's its the least they can do. Plus it makes a pretty good show.
 I oppose the death penalty because I feel that we as a society must rise above our animalistic tendencies for revenge.  We must show that we are better than those who we hold in judgment for their crimes.  The death penalty is an extreme act with no real value to society.  Many criminals who have perpetrated crimes upon society have been shown to be from very unfortunate circumstances.  These people were often abused as children, frequently have a below average IQ, and studies have shown that brain chemistry can be a factor in criminal behavior which may render the criminal with a very limited capacity to make choices other than the ones they have made in life.  It can also be argued that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment because we do not have thorough enough research to understand all the physiological aspects of the suffering a person undergoes through the various means by which the death penalty is carried out.
 I do not believe in the death penalty because it is not for us to decide when someone should die. These are human beings and everyone deserves the chance to change. I think this task also takes a toll on those who have perform the killing. I know in one prison, the warden is responsible for administering the lethal injections. I would imagine that would affect him negatively emotionally.
 Abortion is against God's will.  How will the world ever get better if we allow people to make choice that are against the will of the Creator?  Abortion can ruin a woman's chances to ever bear children again.  It should not be an option at all because there are services available to help women who wish to give up their children for adoption.
 I believe that the availability abortion is an important aspect of maintaining America's standard of living. It helps to prevent a lifelong reduction in educational attainment and earnings (and therefore tax revenues) for those who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy; additionally, the current glut of low-skilled workers on the market creates downward pressure on wages, so a reduction in the birth rate will have a positive effect on wages.
 Abortion being legal is encouraging younger people who cannot support children to have unprotected sex. Because there is an easy way out of the consequences of unprotected sex they feel that it is okay. We should be encouraging young people to accept the responsibility of their actions by living with the consequence of unprotected sex.
 I am for the death penalty for the simple reason I believe it is the ultimate penalty for taking someone's life. Cruel and unusual punishment you say? Well think about the cruel and unusual murder that the murderer had on his victim. As speak about victim, I love how the state of California has a death penalty where the murderers on Death Row on average are there for 30 years. The idea is that these condemned men may not have done it and they should have the right to appeal, appeal and when in doubt appeal. Through political activism and with the help of liberal judges the death penalty in California is a sham. The people have spoken years ago and the Death Penalty should be the "Law of the Land." I think we should do what the people want.
 This person we will call "L" he is great guy and always has your back. He would never get mad at anyone and has the best attitude of anyone I can think of. Even if you could make him mad he would never go to your manager to narc you out over stupid little things. He always has your back and would do anything to help you out. He has even been known to just give things he owns to people whether they need it or not.
 The death penalty prevents death. It discourages criminals from committing the ultimate crime, because that they too might die because of their deed. Having a death penalty marks off this one crime as the one that cannot be made up for, and cannot (in theory) end in a short sentence and a slack probation. Where a death penalty is in force, killers know they will not be freed to kill again.
 Abortion in some sense is just as justifiable to be a methods to eliminate the unjust events effects of one's mistake. It also contributes to the population control of man's propagation in this planet. And if this method is used it will be a successful way of dealing with all this dilemma of man's existence . The over population mostly in the third world.
 Abortion should be supported as people get pregnant by accident and dont want it. imagine a lady that is raped would you want her to have a bastard child that would keep reminding her of the ordeal she went through at the hands of the heartless men. or imagine a situation where a woman's life is endangered by the baby she carries, would you rather she dies than have an abortion? or would you want the fact that aa little girl made a mistake halt her education in life and become dependent on someone? i dont think so
 I believe the death penalty should be enforced. Because in this situation, an eye for an eye can never be completely met when you think about not only if this criminal took the life of another person, you should take into concern all of the emotional suffering you put on everyone involved. But, the death penalty will be as close as you get nonetheless. Also, I don't believe we need to spend our taxpayer's dollars keeping people like this alive, especially when they've done enough that they will never live long enough to exit jail successfully.
 I believe that woman should be able to get abortions for almost any reason. It is their body and their own choice. They should not be forced to support another living being if they don't want to do so. A fetus is not a person until after birth. Therefore, the mother supporting the fetus should not have to keep the baby.
 I think the death penalty is a great way to punish criminals that have committed crimes that cannot be punished in other ways. These criminals need to be punished in a way that shows them but other would be criminals that the crime that took place was wrong. The death penalty should be used on all criminals that choose to murder, rape or otherwise torture other people.
 The death penalty is a deterrent.  It comes from the old eye for an eye philosophy and it keeps justice balanced.  If just one person doesn't commit murder because they don't want to die themselves, the policy is worth it.  We have to keep society safe; this penalty helps to do so.
 The death penalty is good because why should our tax money go to feed and house killers and rapists for 20, 30, 40 years? Our prisons are overcrowded anyway, so why keep someone there for life? Furthermore, putting someone to death who has committed these horrible crimes sends a powerful message and will prevent others from also committing these crimes. I also get pleasure from that fact that these criminals will suffer for what they did.
 Women should not be able to get any abortions. I think that a fetus is a living human and has been from the moment of conception. Intentionally killing a fetus is the same thing as murder. You can't kill people who you don't like just because they are inconvenient to you. A life is a life, no matter what.
 We are so close, more like sisters than friends. We tell eachother everything and are always there for eachother. We like similar things and do activities together. I know she is someone I can always count on. We have been friends for years and will continue to be forever.
 I believe that the death penalty is fair and just punishment for severe crimes against humanity.  The death penalty helps convicted criminals by allowing them to skip the punishment of life in prison, which is not really a life at all, while relieving society of the burden of keeping them alive.  The death penalty is actually more humane than actually keeping the person alive, and the death is as painless as possible.  I believe that all states should adopt and use the death penalty.
 We met in high-school and immediately started hanging out all the time. We even dated twin sisters at one point. That made for some "funny" and interesting conversations. It's really just about having someone I can relate to and get along with. At times we have been roommates. It's lasted over 20 years.
 I think the death penalty should be legal because there are people out there who have done horrible things that deserve to die.  if someone murdered or raped one of my family members I might want to kill them  If I can say that then why should that right be stripped from anyone else.  There are just to many bad peopl out thtere and as a society we need to decrease those numbers.
 I think abortion is evil and should not be allowed in this great country of ours. God hates abortion and women who get abortions. Life begins at conception and a human life is the most precious thing on earth. It should only be allowed in extreme circumstances, and I should get to be the judge of what qualifies as an "extreme circumstance." Male politicians should get to decide what women do to their unborn babies.
 I think that the death penalty is just wrong.  Prisoners should be put away for life for their crimes.  They should not be executed for their actions.  It is not right to take a life for a life.  Executions are inhumane and a cruel form of punishment and should not be used.  Imagine the agony and fear the prisoner faces when he or she is about to be executed.  Also, the prisoner may experience severe pain during the execution.  Criminals like this should just be put away for life even if it means draining tax payer's money.
 My best friend has a really bold personality that's always interesting to be around; there's definitely never a bold moment. She's fun to be around and is loyal to the end. She's incredibly rational and always a great person to turn to for advice or a shoulder to cry on. She's reliable and dependable.
 It is morally wrong to kill. We are putting people in jail for crimes like murder and then using the legal system to turn around and murder them as well. We cannot impress upon people that a certain crime is wrong if we then use that same crime to punish them for - the same crime. It does not teach people a lesson.
 The death penalty is perfectly fine. The penalty fits the crimes commit by those due to be executed. What's fair is what's fair. The rule is, if you have no regard for another's life, we have no regard's for yours.
 While death may be the just end for the truly horrendous criminals, the realities of our justice system make it an unreasonable and untenable punishment. First of all, the cost associated with the lawyers, judges, juries, and other people required to push a sentence of death forward takes a toll on society. Additionally, the justice system does not work perfectly, and death cannot be undone for those who are incorrectly jailed and sentenced. It would be best to abolish the death penalty and instead direct money towards better law enforcement.
 We are a country of laws and regulations that are for the saftey of the majority. Some crimes are so bad that we must remove those offenders from our society completely because it is not worth the risk of keeping them. Some people there is no hope of rehabilitating and it is unfair to ask us to continue to pay to keep them in the system when there is no hope of them turning there life around. The death penalty is about keeping our children and society safe and not burdening the tax payer, it is also setting an example to discourage criminals from committing those crimes.
 I believe abortion is a private personal decision to be made by a women. I think there are plenty of reasons that women choose not to carry a fetus to term, not the least of which are rape, inability to care for an infant, and fear of social retaliation in being pregnant given their current circumstances. I fear for a world that makes abortion illegal and unobtainable for women because desperate women will still find a way to try to abort their pregnancy and then we will return to back alley abortions where women are in danger of harm and even death.  I realize a lot of people argue adoption as a better option for an unwanted pregnancy and although that may be true in some cases, there are teenage girls who get kicked out of their homes for finding themselves pregnant before finishing high school. Adoption does not solve the economic problems they face after becoming homeless.
 Abortion is wrong.  Human beings do not have the right to take the life of another human being for any reason.  A fetus is a helpless living thing & to terminate it's life is morally wrong.  Abortion is a criminal act.
 My best friend and I have a very close relationship since we share common interest. We have known each other since middle school and even though we dont live in the same state, we still keep in touch with one another. Whenever he has a problem, he asks for my advice on the matter and the same applies to me.
 Legalized abortion is absolutely necessary.  Without it, women needing abortions would have to turn to seedy, back alley clinics to receive the treatment, which puts them at risk for uterine infection, medically necessary hysterectomies, and even death.  Women should also have the right to chose what happens to their own bodies.  Even if a woman consents to sex and decides that her body should not have to bear and birth this child, she then should able to make that decision on her own, without feeling like she has no choices.
 While the death penalty is often protested against for various reasons, these reasons amount to little more than emotional or idealistic pleas. The death penalty is important for our society to retain in an effort to preserve a sense of authority. A government exists because it has a monopoly on violence, and it's authority exists on its right to exercise that right. Give that we have a fair and just court system, we are in a unique position amongst the world's nations to flex that right to power in extreme circumstances. Though using this punishment doesn't lower all types of crimes, it is the case that it mitigates the level and types of crime people are willing to commit, while giving our laws themselves the safe-backing that they need to be legitimate in the eyes of the populace.
 The death penalty is a travesty and affront to the civilized world. Almost every other developed country has banned this despicable practice. Murder sanctioned by the state is never right and that is what the death penalty is. Not only does it sometimes result in the killing of an innocent man it wastes tax payer dollars in endless appeals.
 I believe that abortion is morally wrong, I believe that having a abortion is murdering a person and that people who can have a abortion our cold hearted. I believe that if a women can willingly have sex that they should be responsible for the decision to possibly make another human being.
 The death penalty should be allowed in instances that involve a horrendous crime particularly  those that destroy the lives of the people associated with the crime. There comes a point where a criminals action can be so grave that the court has the right to seek redemption by terminated that persons existence. It needs to be done ever so cautiously and as a last resort, but the criminal forfeited his/her rights when they  committed the atrocities.
 Abortion is not a positive experience and rarely one taken lightly. However, the ability for a person to control whether or not they have children is an important right. Until a child is born, the fetus is effectively part of the mother and therefore under her control as part of her body. Without the option of safe abortions, women are forced into bearing children no matter what their personal or financial situation is, making it more difficult for women to plan their families in a productive way.
 I enjoy spending time with my best friend. He does not judge me and treats me as an equal. We enjoy similar things and even if we don't, we are open to trying them. We have a history together and met at a young age. We see each other as friends in the future.
 This person is a wonderful person.  She tells the most interesting stories.  She is never rude.  The sound of her voice makes me happy.  I look forward to seeing her every day.
 I am completely for abortion. I can understand those that oppose abortion as long as it is not for religious reasons, but I am for women's rights before an unborn fetuses rights. I know that it should be rights for both, but there is no way to have rights for both when the baby is a part of the mother. The mother gets priority, simple as that.
 The death penalty is horrible. No one should ever be allowed to give such a penalty. There is no crime that should be punished with death. Even those that are as bad as murderers should not die for their actions.
 Abortion is despicable because we're giving women the choice to kill life. Where is the unborn child's voice? Do we not care about those who can't defend themselves. Abortion is systemic murder that needs to be stopped.
 Life is sacred. Who are we to end a life? People, even criminals, deserve to live. They deserve a second chance. When we end their lives, we end the possibility of them turning their lives around--even if that is within a prison setting.
 Women should not be given the option to abort because it is murder. Abortion is the equivalent of murdering a child. If women are given the option to abort their babies, teenage girls will carry on with their sexual indiscretion with no consequences. There are options for women these days such as adoption. They can simply have the baby and then put it up for adoption. It is our job as the citizens of AMerica to look out for these unborn children.
 My best friend lives with me and we spend a lot of time together. We have a lot in common and our discussions are always funny. We love a lot of the same kinds of movies and have a very good time watching them. Our dispositions are similar and she is always kind to me. She's a very good person.
 Hello, Today I will talk to you about abortion. I think Abortion should be legal up especially under circumstances of rape or sexual abuse. This is a very controversial topic around liberals and conservatives. Whatever you believe about life and death or the fact of the human body having a soul, all must think about the many women forced to have sex by family members or other sick individuals. They shouldn't have to deal with bringing up a child under those circumstances. Thank you.
 The death penalty is a cruel act. You're either electrocuted so that your insides are cooked. Or given a series of injections that paralyze you while you drown in your own bodily fluids. Or you're placed against a wall facing a gunman aiming a rifle at you, ready to give said wall a fresh coat of paint.
 The death penalty is wrong every way you look at it. Who is to say that a person deserves to die based on a crime they commited. Do people think they are God now? Do they think the fate of someone''s life and death is in their hands?
 Sally always told me how much she cared about me.  She talked about being with me and helping me in re=establishing my life.  She understood the circumstances I was in, and was generally patient as well as thoughtful.  I hope she will always be close to me.  I want to give her a nice home one day and give her all the comfort she deserves.
 The death penalty is a capital punishment that is very necessary. Some people do such inhumane crimes, they do not deserve to breath the air of the non-guilty. Also, if death is a possible punishment, perhaps it will deter future crimes, since the person committing the act knows he can possible be put to death for his crimes.
 I am pro choice. I believe a woman has the right to make choices regarding her own body. I am an agnostic so my stance on abortion is not determined for me by the Catholic church or whatever religion I might belong to. As with most social issues abortion is very complex. However I believe that the only way to assess each abortion case is rationally and without religious bias.
 The death penalty is an inhumane punishment that no one should have to suffer through, regardless of the crime done. The person who committed the crime has other options for punishment besides death, like life in prison with a severe amount of rehabilitation.
 I feel that all life is sacred, and I feel even more strongly that conscious life should be allowed to control its own destiny.  I don't view unborn fetuses before a certain point as conscious life; really, it's more of a parasite than anything else.  I know this is a cold view to take but that's how I think.  My stepdad molested me and had sex with me when I was a teenager.  If I had gotten pregnant, and had been forced to endure bearing the child to term, my life would have been drastically different.  It would have negatively affected my physical health and development as well as my progress in my education, not to mention it would be a constant reminder of what I had gone through.  In cases of incest, abuse, rape, fatal fetal malformations, danger to the mother, or unplanned pregnancy, abortion should always be available as an option.  No child should come into the world unwanted.
 Taking a life is never the answer to any problem. Life without the possibility of getting out is deterrent enough. We as a society do not have to sink to the same level as the very criminals that we are sentencing. The fact that they are behind bars is more then enough to give us the peace that we need to sleep at night.
 My real opinion about abortion is that every woman has the right to do what she chooses with her body. In some situations it is better to give the soul back to the Universe because it is not the time or the place. Sometimes I think it's better to allow the child to continue on and give it up for adoption but I do not have the right to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body.
 We get along. Share a few common interest. Help each other out with things the other is better at. From the same place.
 I believe that abortion is moral in any situation. A mother has the right to decide what happens to her body and if she doesn't want a baby then she has the right no get rid of it. A fetus is not a living person yet so it has no rights. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and a person should not have their life ruined because of one mistake.
 My best friend and I met when we got hired at the same time at my job four years ago. We got a long right away, we had similar interests in sports and video games alike. We now live together as roommates. We usually hang out on the weekends and go out to bars/clubs.
 I believe that the death penalty is a good way to get people to stop doing the awful crimes that has been going on for decades. The states that have the death penalty seem to have less crimes than the states that don't have it. I believe its a good way to make people thing twice before committing a serious crime. I believe that it should be apart of our judicial system.
 Death penalty is the ultimate punishment. In my opinion, it should only be used for very serious crimes, and where the evidence is absolutely beyond a doubt. Eyewitness evidence, if only one person might not be enough. I am not completely against the death penalty, for those that do terrible crimes over and over again, show no remorse, etc., I think the death penalty is appropriate. It provides some small closure for family members of the victim.  One thing I come back to is the number of prisoners exonerated from DNA evidence. If they were executed, obviously no way back. Another thing against the DP is the cost, surprisingly more expensive to execute someone.
 The death penalty can do a few things. First and foremost it is used as an example. It shows that you cannot just live behind bars with your food paid for, there is something worse that can happen. In the Philippines i believe you are not allowed to even spit on the street. Thus they don't have to worry about crime because they see what happens when you make a mistake. Inmates cost the state and country an incredible amount of money. If you are someone that takes the lives of numerous people, then it would not be unreasonable for that favor to be returned.
 Religious right wingers want to interfere with a woman's right to safely and legally terminate unwanted and or dangerous pregnancies. This is an issue of basic human rights.  A woman should have the right to decide about matters that affect her body and well being.  To allow anti-abortion activists to picket and harass women seeking legal abortion is morally wrong and should be banned.
 Society needs the death penalty. It deters future criminals and is the only way for families to obtain retribution and move on. There is no disproportionate discrimination in society; the people who get the most death sentences just happen to be minorities. We cannot do without the death penalty because it teaches people that they cannot just get away with capital crimes.
 abortion is morally wrong because every conceived life has a right to live, if the mother cant take care of the child there are so many needing families who would lovingly take it.
 I believe that everyone has their own personal beliefs, but I feel like abortion should only be done on a raped victim who wants to get rid of it. This was forced sex by a disgusting human being.So I believe if the woman wants to get rid of it , they should definitely be able to.
 The death penalty is taking punishment far to extreme. Just because someone makes a mistake doesn't mean they should be killed for that fact. You are not there when the incident happened so you should not be able to decide the fate of another man. The death penalty is painful and taking it to the furthest point just so the government and prove a point.
 I have mixed but definable opinions about the death penalty.  I believe that it needs to exist but it is what I would say is a necessary evil.  There are a few circumstances that it is necessary to take human life that usually are based on protecting other human life.  In the case of irrefutable evidence I believe that the death penalty falls under the necessity of ending a life that would be a certain threat to others.  Although the person would not be able to return to society, it would put the burden of the care upon the very society that the criminal would harm to sustain his/her life.  It also continues to put the jailer's lives in harms way. Additionally it may result in saving innocent lives by providing a sufficient deterrent to another criminal doing likewise. In the extreme cases therefore, I believe the death penalty is necessary and just.
 He is such a nice guy. He is always wanting to hang out and chill. We love the same things. We act like we are brothers
 Sometimes a crime is committed that is so odious to the moral sense that only supreme justice is called for. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not deter capital crimes. It can purge society's lingering guilt in the fact that justice is complete and final. Victims' families can get some well-deserved closure and society can move on from the crime without having to wait for a life sentence to be served.
 I support the right to access abortion services. Women, and their partners if applicable, need to have complete control over their reproductive faculties. Abortion is a safe means of preventing unwanted children. Terminating a pregnancy is no different than using birth control or other methods of contraception. Some would claim that abortion requires taking a life, but I believe that abortion is not much different that engaging in sexual activities for reasons other than procreation, since these often involve living cells being expended. Additionally, unwanted children can cause financial burdens to families which results in poor quality of life for the children.
 If we make abortion against the law the rise of unwanted children is going to be at an all time high. A lot of Americans are adopting overseas and our orphaned children here are going through a horrible life. If those anti-abortion protestors really believe in the right to life, then they should provide a better life for these children. Many of these children will be in the lower social hierarchy for their entire lives. Legal abortion is a very safe procedure. There are also many religions that are actually pro choice.
 I beleive that abortion is a cruel and inhuman way that ultimately ends a childs life.  I feel the length of time given to a woman to terminate pregnancy is entirely too long and at that point it is what appears to me to be legal murder. I witnessed an abortion when I made a decision to support a family member who felt it was her only choice. I quickly found out that there has to be a better way. I don't know exactly what the answer is, but clearly abortion is not the correct one. If I understand correctly, a woman can be up to 24 or 25 weeks and still terminate. This is a person, although small, but one that has eyes, a nose, mouth, etc....Thats life. And the ability to give something that we don't have the ability to give legally that could have been avoided by other means just seems a bit wrong to me.
 The absence of a death penalty would encourage potential pursuers of capital crimes to go forwards with their intentions. Even if they're caught, the law won't permit them to be physically harmed. In fact, there is even a chance they could settle down with a nice life in prison with friends, spouse, etc. Only the threat of death will be enough to dissuade sane but evil criminals from enacting their murderous plans.
 I work with my best friend. They are always there to offer up an opinion on any matter. Whenever someone starts a conversation, my BF is a social butterfly and enjoys providing a suggestion or opinion if he's around. He also likes ending conversations by making some form of a joke. I can always count on his to be there.
 I believe that abortion is the right way to go.Too many teenagers are getting pregnant these days and are not responsible enough to care for a baby.Abortion also is a good thing for those women who conceive a baby while being raped.I don't believe anyone who gets pregnant when they were raped should have the baby because the baby would always be a constant reminder on that incident.
 I believe in the death penalty because there are those who choose not to be rehabilitated. To me, the death penalty should be reserved for criminals who have shown no sign of remorse or desire to change. Two examples of these types of criminals are, pedophiles and serial killers. Career criminals should also be considered for the death penalty where a heinous murder has been committed.
 Life is sacred, no matter what its form.  There's no way of knowing when consciousness begins in the fetus, and abortion at any trimester is a cruel death penalty for an innocent that was never even given a chance.  Women who have unwanted pregnancies, for any reason, have many other options besides abortion.  There are so many couples out there wanting to adopt; no life should be thrown away like a piece of trash.
 I believe that a fetus is a "baby" at the point of conception. If a woman chooses to abort a pregnancy then she is committing murder. There are no circumstances in which I believe an abortion is safe and/or necessary. I also believe that a father has a say over the life he helped to create so a woman seeking an abortion should not be allowed to do so if the father does not consent. I feel like there are other viable alternatives, such as adoption, that a woman could turn to in the event of an unwanted pregnancy.
 the death penalty should be abolished. killing someone non matter who they are is inhumane. there is no reason for someone to die no matter what kind of crime they committed. the drugs for the death penalty are expensive and in humane. killing someone in response to what they did is not equal. two wrongs do not make a right. the taxes paid for people on death row would be used for something else just as bad like bailing out companies that can't keep the finances together
 My friend thinks a lot like me. We both have the same birthdate which I find funny. We both like Reddit and share anecdotes from links on there. Our outlook on life is very similar.
 Some people cannot be rehabilitated and definitely should not be released back into the society they have harmed.  Recidivism, or engaging in a repeated offense, is a common theme among many violent criminals.  For those that engage in mortal sins such as murder, there really is no reason to keep them in the prison population where they can take up space and most likely continue in their behaviors.  Also, and the victims of such people deserve to see justice performed.
 I met this guy awhile back through my girlfriend at the time.  He worked with her and they became friends.  I liked him a lot because he was funny and respected her boundaries as a person.  I really wish I could see him more often.  It's a shame me and her broke up because I miss hanging out with him so much.
 A woman has the right to choose whether or not to have sex with a man, whether or not to marry, why would she not also have the right to choose whether or not to become a Mother? Recently a man in congress who was campaigning for anti-abortion was asked, "Why do you think a woman would want to get an abortion?" His response was, "I've never really thought about it!" Think about that. A man who will never get pregnant, never feel a life growing inside of him, never be exposed to the pain and risks of giving birth has never thought about why a woman would want to have an abortion and yet he is campaigning for the law that wouldn't allow a woman to have that option. I got pregnant at fifteen years old. I did not make the decision to have sex, I did not fail to use birth control during a voluntary act. I was walking home from gymnastics and I was raped. I was not prepared to be a Mother physically, I was not equipped to carry the child of a rapist emotionally. Had I not had that option available to me I don't know what would have happened. Before you take part in trying to make a decision for a woman, try walking a day in a woman's shoes.
 I have to say that I am torn on abortion, but I lean toward the side against it.  On one hand, I am a feminist and I think that women should be able to do with their bodies what they feel is best, but on the other hand, what they are able to do with abortion affects not only their bodies but their unborn babies, as well as the father (sometimes).  It is hard to feel sorry for a woman that chooses abortion if she chose not to use birth control, more specifically condoms.  Any woman raped should be able to choose medical abortion, but I really strongly feel that abortion should not be a means of birth control.  It should always, always be a last resort, and women who get multiple abortions should be bitch-slapped.
 Abortion is a women's right to be able to choose what to do with their body. It is not up to a man or government to tell a woman what they can do with their body. It is moral to have a abortion. A fetus is not living until later in the pregnancy.
 I love penalty death. The people who make severe mistake should be treated in the proper way. Death is a final procedure. It worth to do so.
 The Death Penalty is odious for a variety of reasons. First, it makes the state the arbiter of death, a position from which its power can be abused. Second it amplifies the biases already present in the justice system, falling on minority prisoners more often than not. Third, it's eradication would be a cost reducer in the justice system. These are the three main reasons sensible people should oppose the death penalty.
 The death penalty is a just deterrent for some of the worst crimes. There is not rehabilitating some criminals and for those the only answer is to put them out of their misery. There is no excuse to continue filling up prisons we can't afford to pay for. It is only fair to many of the families of the victims. It is time we clear out some of the burdens put on the states by allowing those that need it to be put to death.
 The Death Penalty is immoral. It doesn't belong in our society. How can you justify one death for another? We aren't God therefore we shouldn't play him.
 I believe that all abortion is wrong.  It is murder.  The fetus is a human life and no one has the right to end that life.  Adoption could always be an option.  Abortions are too easily available and are misused as a form or birth control.  Careful sex or family planning is a more viable option.
 We have a lot in common. We like spending time together. We have similar interests and goals in life. We have not fought or gotten in serious arguments.
 My best friend is caring and always there for me. He may be the most honest and trustworthy person person know. I don't know what I would do without the assistance I get from him. The support I need and the nonjudgmental ways he has interact very well with my personality.
 I believe people should be able to do what they want with their bodies. There's too many babies and kids in social services why add more? If your not capable of raising a child, then don't.
 I've known my best friend since first grade.  We were in cub scouts together.  We went to school together and have stayed in touch for most of my life.  We just look out for each other.  If one of us is in trouble the other will always help.  He's like a brother.
 I think that while abortion is a horrible thing to do, it should be legal for anyone to get if they so choose. If people take precautions to avoid pregnancy and still get pregnant, abortion is a viable option. If someone uses abortion as their only form of birth control, they should be punished. A man and woman should decide together about weather abortion takes place. Men should also have the right, if they so choose, to legal decline responsibility for the child if they took precautions against pregnancy and the conception still takes place, and the mother decides against an abortion.
 I believe in pro-life. Abortion is the act of killing a fetus. A baby human who is defenseless. If mothers don't want to raise their baby they can give it up for adoption. Abortions causes a lot of stress on a woman's reproductive system and may cause health complications for that woman in the future. Women need to control their bodies by being responsible and using contraception. in the case of rape, the rapist should be punished. Do not punish the defenseless unborn baby.
 In some cases the Death Penalty is not just an option but required due to the severity of the crime. Some crimes are so bad that death is the only option. Especially when the punishment rarely lasts as long as what the jury decides at the end of the case. Crimes against children and pregnant women are two examples.
 I believe that although abortion is an unpleasant subject to discuss it is n important right that must remain for women.  Some people believe that abortion is wrong for religious reasons but no person should be able to force their beliefs on somebody else.  There are instances where a child would be brought into an unsafe and unsafe living environment or be predisposed to a serious and painful life long disease.  In these cases it might be that abortion is the best of only bad options.  It should be the right of every individual to make that decision for themselves.
 The death penalty is wrong because it is never right to take another person's life.  We can never truly be certain of someone's guilt or innocence.  Too many times we have declared someone who had been put to death actually innocent.  I feel this makes us murderers ourselves and no better than the criminals.  Also, the ways we put people to death are painful and inhumane.
 A life given for one taken.  A sentence of death should make someone stop and think before killing another person.  Criminals convicted of the death penalty should be executed within a short period of time.  Death sentences instead of life in prison would save the penal system money.
 I believe the death penalty is a necessary evil in this country. If we didn't have a death penalty, there would be no consequences for that action. Its unnecessary to crowd our prisons with Life Term inmates. Eye for an Eye is how I feel.
 The death penalty is the ultimate eye-for-an-eye punishment and should be used more often. The death penalty sentence is not used unless criminals are guilty of heinous crimes, often involving multiple murders. Eliminating one person that killed multiple victims is the only justifiable punishment. These people are criminals and they do not deserve to continue to live in our prisons, costing tax payers money. Providing these criminals with a dignified, humane, and pain free death is more than they ever showed to their victims.
 Can tell her anything. She's fucking hot. We have a similar sense of humor. No drama if we talk too little or talk too much. No expectations. It's basically an ideal friendship.
 "John" Is a great person. John always puts himself before others. John never says derogatory remarks to people. John is the type of person you would want by your side in case of an emergency.
 Abortion gives women an easy way out of their accidental responsibilities so that they become unaccountable for their sexual escapades. Abortion means the killing of life after conception. Abortion affects women emotionally and can leave a lasting psychological affect. The taking of life is not of God's will as he created women to procreate.
 I believe the death penalty should be abolished. It is hypocritical for us to sentence anyone death. Who are we to judge who deserves the right to live? Not to mention the fact that there have been numerous cases in which someone sentenced to death was proved innocent before their execution date. It is a cruel policy that has no place in modern society.
 And God said, Thou Shalt Not Kill. Abortion is murder and we should not do it because it is morally wrong.
 I believe abortion is wrong when used inappropriate. Regardless of the situation, abortion is taking a human life. Life begins at conception and terminating that life after it is created is killing. In certain cases, it may be entirely appropriate for an abortion to be performed such as in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother's life is in jeopardy. It makes it more palatable when one can understand that up to a certain point, there is no consciousness.
 I feel like the death penalty is absolutist 100% needed. I feel like there is no hope for anyone. If they are bad they will always be bad and the death penalty is for them. I feel like we should be using it more often because it will rid the world of those who cannot be saved!
 My best friend, we will call him "Bob" is a truly exeptional person. I can talk to Bob about anything and everything. Bob and I can make "your mom" jokes in any situation we are in. Bob is always there for me.
 It is not right to kill. The death penalty cost the states a great deal of money more than life. A person should have to live with their past. Death is to easy. It would be better if the person payed back their debt to society.
 I believe that all women should have the option to abort their unborn fetus within the first two trimesters. I don't believe they should be required to view an ultrasound beforehand or any other such procedure. At the end of the day, pregnancy is a huge burden on the body, and a person should not be required to go through that if they choose not to. Furthermore, I don't consider a fetus to have the same status as a full person deserving of human rights. Within the first two trimesters, the fetus is part of the woman, completely dependent on feeding off her body for its life, and so I believe the woman has the right to choose to have it removed from her body. However, I am unsure of my position on later term abortions, because I believe that once the fetus has the potential to survive outside the womb, it may be deserving of human rights.
 I have known my best friend for over 20 years, we grew up together. We have a strong childhood bond that we've been able to maintain and grow upon throughout the years. We have a similar personality and sense of humor. We also have different tendencies which makes it enjoyable for us to compare our differences. If I'm in a bad mood, venting frustrations to my friend helps. I thoroughly enjoy her conversation and company even though we no longer live in the same state.
 The Death Penalty is just another form of murder. People who support the death sentence are just as bad as the guilty who are sentenced to die. The bible says to forgive and people need to practice what they preach. It is not for us to decide who dies or lives no matter what they do to others.
 The death penalty can sometimes kill someone who is innocent. If someone didn't have a fair trial, yet sentenced to death, their death is equivalent to the victim. Death penalty is wrong because it is not man's job to judge who deserves like, but up to God. The death people does not offer first time major offenders a chance to be rehabilitated.If an innocent person is killed from the death penalty, there is still someone on the streets committing the crime.
 Chris is such a dear. You can always count on her for the most devastating personal gossip. Somehow, she just ferrets out people's secrets, and it's so entertaining to hear her share them. She is quick to take the lead, too, and guide other people's behavior, because she has such confidence in her own standards and values, and is so anxious to share them with everyone she knows. And the conversation never lags when you're around her, because she always has an opinion about everything!
 the death penalty is necessary to achieving less criminals in america. a criminal, for example, is less likely to commit a crime if he knows that he can be sentenced to death as a punishment. death penalty has been proven to be effective in the past. crime rates have lowered because of it's existence in states.
 People who have committed these horrible acts need to be killed. They do not belong in society or deserve tax payer money and care for them to live out their life. They are unable to be rehabilitated, which is the purpose of the criminal justice system. They don't deserve to live in this world.
 I think the death penalty is fine.  If you're truly a detriment to society, why should you be allowed to live off the taxes of people who aren't?  Sure one or two innocent people might die here and there, but lets be honest, we're at a population cap as it is.  If I were to go on a killing spree, I'd hope that I wouldn't have to suffer remembering every bit of it, I'd rather be killed.
 What are the costs of keeping the death penalty?  One of the costs is the potential of putting innocent people to death that were wrongly convicted.  Juries make mistakes all the time and innocent people have been put to death in the past.  Is one innocent life put to death important enough to stop using the entire system?  In this case, I believe so.
 Abortion should be outlawed.  This is because it is morally wrong, in any situation.  Regardless of the circumstances, the taking an unborn child's life should never occur.  The unborn infant has the right to life, just like the rest of us.
 My view on the death penalty is that it is a good thing. The death penalty punishes those that commit severe crimes, by death. The death penalty also gives the victims families the much needed closure that they deserve. The penalty shows other would be criminals the severe consequences of bad actions.
 Abortion is wrong. No matter why a woman believes it should happen, it is wrong. Each women should feel the guilt of having an abortion as it is a sin. This should not even be a problem. Each life is a miracle.
 There is this guy that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me with. He is so handsome and caring. He is honest and trustworthy, and he is really charming too. I also think he would be a good friend to have, since he's so nice. He's a really good person overall, and I feel like he would never wrong anybody on purpose.
 I believe that abortion is an easy escape to being irresponsible. If you think your responsible enough to have unprotected sex, then shouldn't you be responsible enough to take care of a baby? The only way I think abortions should be allowed is in cases of rape, or life threatening pregnancies. Plus, there's thousands of families who wish to have kids and can't. If you become pregnant, and don't want the baby, just allow the baby a good like with someone that would want it.
 The death penalty is not a good thing to have in any state, people can be falsely accused on a crime that they didn't do. It wouldn't solve any problems with crimes in their states having the death penalty and they will still continue to commit the crimes and it wouldn't even bother them. It's not a good option to have and it should be stopped.
 Hello all and welcome for coming. Today, I want to briefly discuss the topic of abortion.  I think most people, regardless of what side of the topic you are on, can agree that the circumstances around abortion are not ideal.  That being said, I see the need to look at these situations realistically.  Unwanted children, or children that cannot be adequately provided for suffer in this world.  We should take bringing a new life into the world seriously.  If we know that the life will be difficult from the very beginning, is it really fair for us to demand it be lived?  I think every woman takes this seriously, and it is not society's place to make such decisions for her because we think she messed up or could have prevented the situation.  A woman should have the right to decide what's best for her potential children, and that may mean not having one.  No woman takes this decision lightly, and society should not put any more stress on her personal decision.  I think we should let women decide, and trust that women can make appropriate, loving decisions.
 Life begins at the moment of conception. If you choose to have sex, you choose to take on the responsibility of birth control. If you fail to take responsibility for your action and thus get pregnant you create a life that has a right to be given a chance, just like you once were. If you're not prepared to be a parent there's long waiting lists of deserving couples who can't conceive on their own who would make wonderful parents. Be responsible, give life to the life you created.
 Abortion kills babies! We all have a heartbeat at 18 days old, who can justify killing a baby with a heartbeat? Every baby has a right to live. No child is unwanted, there always will be a place for our precious little ones. Abortion is killing our babies and our futures with them.
 My best friend really looks out for me. He shows me how to get things done in an efficient manner. My best friend also speaks highly of me to others and is not intimidated by my being. He really likes that I can solve problems on my own and really likes that I call on him for help sometimes.
 This is a very sensitive subject. Abortion has been legal for some time now. I believe that it should be the decision of the woman as to what will happen. There is rape and other situations and the woman should make the choice. On that hand that woman should take into consideration that this is something that she cannot change after doing.
 I personally believe that the death penalty should be legal in all states. Although the exact mechanism can be debated, the penalty itself should stay. I feel like executing criminals is cheaper than life sentences. As long as this saves money I am all for it.
 I believe that every women has a right to choose whether she wants to have an abortion or not.  However, she should be at least 18 years old to make that choice on her own.  Abortions should be limited to the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.  Any pregnancys after that gestation should not be permitted to be terminated.
 Every woman should have the right to make decisions about her body. Making abortion legal gives women the chance for quality medical care. Every baby that is born should be born to someone who loves and wants it. Do we want to go back to a time when a women had to go to a back alley to get an abortion from an unlicensed and unregulated practitioner?
 The death penalty is acceptable and useful in theory but distorted by society's current and past applications. It is correct morally, from a consequentialist perspective, that a murderer should have his life taken in return for another's. But statistics show that minorities and men are heavily discriminated against by receiving a disproportionate amount of death sentences. The death penalty should not be practiced currently and should only be reinstated when better and more objective evidentiary and judicial measures can be practiced.
 Barbara is warm and loving. Her children know they can count on her, in fact, though they're grown, she "lends" them money constantly. She's fun, she is honest without being devastatingly honest, and I believe I can count on her. She is also highly intelligent, and fond of cats.
 I am opposed to abortion. I think a fetuses right is highly important and should take precedence of a mother's right. She will just have to give the baby up for adoption. There is no reason to kill a living thing just because of your own selfish reasons.
 I don't think the death penalty should be allowed.  The death penalty is inhumane and no one has the right to take someones life.  Not even the government.  If someone murders a person then that person should go to jail for a really long time or even for the rest of their lives.  As long as they are kept outside of society we can be safe.  There is no need to kill them in order to protect society.
 every state should have the death penalty. i believe that the death penalty should be ore severe depending on what the crime was. i firmly believe that if you murder someone you should get the same penalty that you gave them. if you shot and killed someone you should be sht and killed as well. i disagree with people who think the death penalty should be humane. it was not humane when the person committed the crime so why should the criminal be treated the same. i believe people who get life in prison should get the death penalty. paying for people to spend life in jail is a waste of state and federal tax money. that money chouls be used to people who need it and making school better.
 I believe that there are good reasons for the death penalty.I believe that the death penalty is in place for a good reason and should be used when necessary. Especially if it is a heinous crime/s. The death penalty is put in place for a good reason and it should not be abused.
 "Judge not lest ye be judged."  These are still important words that should resonate throughout courts.  The death penalty might be a contact sport in Texas, but most other states, and most other countries have turned their backs on this form of 'an eye for an eye.'  It does not reduce the amount of crime, and even people who receive the death penalty will spend the rest of their lives on death row, never to have to experience the penalty.  That makes it meaningless, it gives rise to silly lawsuits from prisoners on death row who have far too much time on their hands, and states spend fortunes on these 'special' prisoners.
 Abortion is not murder.  A baby is not considered a human being until it exits the womb and takes its first breath.  Up until that point it is just a mass of cells that does not have life, feel pain, or exist as a human.  Until the baby exits, it is simply a piece of a mother's body, such as an arm or leg.
 I am opposed to the use of capital punishment for several reasons. The first is that it is applied unequally. In cases where the death penalty could be sought, prosecutors sought that penalty only a very small percentage of the time. When it was sought, statistics show the African American men made up more than half of those cases, while they represent far less than half of eligible cases. That is discriminatory usage, and therefore wrong. The second reason I am against it is because sometimes mistakes will be made and it will be used on an innocent person.  Finally, I do not believe it serves as a deterrent to murderers. Lifetime incarceration is the appropriate punishment for severe crimes.
 My best friend and I are so close because I trust him completely and I know I can always be comfortable around him, rather than having to pretend to have (or not have) certain qualities. We can have a good time doing almost anything, even going on a long drive in mostly silence. We share similar interests and are generally interested in doing the same things, so there's rarely a conflict when hanging out together. My best friend is always there for me when I need him, regardless of whether what I need him for is serious or not.
 Abortion should never take place. Why should a woman have the right to do what she wants with her own body? Her body belongs to someone other than herself. This is hard to do because I really don't believe this and have a hard time even writing these things. Well, the universe should allow all babies to be born.
 All human life is priceless and valuable. We have basic rights to life, liberty, and justice, despite what we may have done to our fellow human beings. Criminals who have committed heinous crimes absolutely deserve to life their lives in jail. It is a benefit to the taxpayers to never have a false conviction on their consciences and as such, they can support the most reasonable option: a jail sentence.
 I believe we should abolish or reform the use of the death penalty. The death penalty as it currently is practiced has been shown to be more expensive than housing a prisoner for life. Current research does not support the idea that it is an especially effective deterrent. The death penalty in my mind represents the failure of citizens to understand that it is not the states responsibility to punish, it is the states job to protect law abiding citizens from criminals and prison is an appropriate vehicle for this. Furthermore I oppose the death penalty due to its unequal application between different races and socioeconomic classes.
 I stand for the death penalty. I believe someone that does harm to someone else, deserves to be punished. There are people in this world that are so cruel and undeserving that they just want to take someone else's life for their gain. The death penalty is harsh, but I believe that if someone's intentions are to do intentional bodily injury to someone else, they deserve to get the same punishment on themselves.
 I am pro-choice. Most fetus are aborted during the first trimester thus it can't exist indepedent outside the womb. It would be a stretch to consider aborting a fetus at that stage murder. If a women is raped, she should definately be given the choice to decide if she wants to give birth to a baby as a result of rape. Women should have complete control over her body especially when it comes to making a choice about abortions. Bringing an unwanted baby into the world results in many negative impacts on the mother, the baby and others.
 Legislation concerning abortion is a necessary evil. There are too many people in the world and we are too interdependent to just let everybody do whatever they want whenever and how ever they want to do it. Besides, the very idea that there MAY be a concerned deity would suggest that if anyone was going to be punished for having abortions then we all will be punished for letting them be allowed. So while the abortion issue appears to be a matter of morality, the fact is that at least in a democratic nation the government has right and reason to have legislative control over abortion.
 I believe abortion is appropriate in certain situations. Rape, incest, gross birth defects, or when pregnancy could cause adverse effects to the mother's health. Abortion should not be a form of contraception or be conducted without the father's knowledge (if the father is known). I believe life begins at conception and abortion is murder, but I can sympathize with women who make the decision to abort based on the aforementioned situations.
 I beleive the system that supports abortions is necessary. If we don't possess anything else in society we own the right to make our own decisions and choices. A woman should be able to choose whether or not her body will be used to support life. If she chooses not too that is her right.  There are several woman that have been robbed of their choice to conceive in the first place and to not give them a means to decide whether or not they want to live with a constant reminder of how their rights and body were initially violated would be cruel and insensitive.  There are also other women that simply don't have the financial,emotional,or physical means to raise a child. I would rather them to make the choice early than to give birth to a child that does not have a fighting chance. At the end of the day it is the womans body and it should be her choice.
 I think the death penalty should be abolished or seriously looked into. What if the evidence that incriminated the defendant is invalid? What if after years of research it was found that the defendant was innocent but he was already executed? You're deciding whether someone lives or dies when they could very well deserve to live due to bad evidence.
 I am anti abortion. Having an abortion is the same thing as murder. An unborn child is alive in the mother's womb and can feel the pain of an abortion.  The fetus at any stage of development has the right to live and that right is being taking away by this procedure. In addition, in some states, such as NJ, an abortion can be performed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. That's almost 6 months! At month 6 the baby weighs about 1-3/4 to 2 lbs and is about 11 to 14 inches long. Baby is able to have dreams and even hiccup.
 I believe a woman should not get an abortion for no good reason, she should be have the baby no matter what the concerquences. She should have the baby life is too important to discard like that. It's important to take care of the baby and not treat it like a problem by getting an abortion. Life is precious and should be pro choice.
 Abortion stops a beating heart. It devalues human life.  The baby becomes "tissue" or "the fetus" and loses it's humanity.  It is a barbaric practice that has tried to become acceptable by claiming to be a woman's choice. Where's the baby's choice? Why should one persons rights supersede another's?
 He is an awesome guy! We have been best friends for many years and do everything together. Always has my back and is very loyal. We have been through thick and thin together. We love to go to sports events, bowling and playing cards. I love him like a brother.
 Abortion should be totally up to the woman.  It is her body and thus, her right.  An embryo is not alive until the 2nd trimester.  It's just a thing so the woman has a perfect right to say whether or not she wants to go through a pregnancy.  Besides, the world is crowded enough as it is.  An unwanted baby only adds to society's burden.
 I don't believe the death penalty is necessary. People would be better to face humiliation and die in jail, living out a long life of solitude. They aren't hurting anyone or causing another person trouble if they're in jail being watched over. Killing people just shows how cruel a human being can be, why should we do the same?
 Abortion is murder.  It's really that simple.  Life begins at conception and just because a woman finds it inconvenient to give birth, that little life inside her deserves his/her chance to live.  She has options: give the child up for adoption, for example.  That is much better than aborting an innocent baby.
 I personally believe that the death penalty is immoral. It is not right for another human being to take another persons life. This is GODs place to judge not peoples. Even if a person that committed a crime took the life of another, that does not mean that it would in any way be OK for someone to take their life. There is a judgment after death and someone who has taken a life will have to answer for it at that time.
 Anyone who commits murder deserves no less for themselves.  They need to know that they cannot get away with taking anotherâ€™s life.  What better way than to know that what awaits you if you commit murder is that you will have your own life taken from you?  Some may argue that the in todayâ€™s system, rarely does anyone on death row actually ever be put to death.  True.  So get rid of all of the bureaucracy!  If a jury finds someone guilty, put them to death without delay.  Iâ€™m not arguing that there shouldnâ€™t be mandatory appeals, but fast-track them.  There are those that argue that some innocent people have been put on death row, but evidence and witness memories donâ€™t get better with age.  There is no reason a victimâ€™s family should have to suffer more than the person who committed the crime.
 I believe that abortion is horrible. A mother's role is to take care of and protect a child. For the first nine months of a child's life, she does this inside of her own body. However, just because the baby is so helpless at this stage and no one has met it yet, a mother may feel that she is in control of its destiny. So, she thinks it is her choice whether the baby lives or dies. To make herself feel better, she calls the baby an embryo. Instead of murder, she calls it abortion or termination. People think that an unborn baby is not alive because it is small. But if something growing with a heartbeat is not alive, what is? There are people hooked up to machines to put air in their lungs and keep their heart beating. They have less life function than an embryo, and yet it would be illegal to disconnect them from their life source. Why? Because we can see their faces, that's why. Somebody had a chance to love them, that's why.
 Abortion is a woman's right because it is a private medical issue that doesn't involve anyone but herself. A fetus at the cut off age for abortion is without a doubt not a person, but a potential person. Abortion is often a difficult choice for women, and to assume that she hasn't thought about her situation and what is the best choice is disrespectful. Without abortion there would be more women in danger, and more unwanted children.
 I believe the death penalty is an appropriate punishment in our society.  It serves as both a punitive measure against the criminal and as a deterrent for others who may consider the same actions.  As a society that values life, we must have something in place that helps to keep order in society and serves as a measure to reduce the potential for capital crimes; capital murder, other felonies with extenuating circumstances, etc.  When someone has committed a heinous crime that takes away the sense of security in society and does grievous harm to a community and family, there is an innate need for justice.  We are a Christian nation and a nation that largely upholds certain biblical tenents, such as an eye for an eye.  While this may seem harsh to some, time and time again the death penalty has been shown to give a measure of comfort to families of victims.
 I believe in the power of the death penalty. If someone has killed another person, that person deserves to have the same thing happen to them. The Bible says an eye for an eye, and as a society, Christians should uphold this doctrine. The criminal should not get special treatment or should not suffer; he or she made the family and friends of the one killed suffer.
 I absolutely support the death penalty. These people have committed horrific crimes and deserve to be punished accordingly. They no longer deserve rights as they have taken away the rights of their victims. It also is more cost effective, if the death penalty is issued quickly, as the person is not costing the tax payers money as a prisoner for the rest of their lives.
 The death penalty is and always has been meant to be a deterrent to crime.  If you kill someone, you are meant to think that if youâ€™re caught, you will die.  That is not the case.   Iâ€™m not sure it ever has been.  For whatever reason, people who commit murder are either very calculating and know they will get away with it, or they do it in the heat of whatever anger or drug rage brought it about.  In neither case would someone stop to think rationally, if I do this, I might die.  Even if they did, by the time theyâ€™ve lived through all of the mandatory appeals, it is hardly worth anyoneâ€™s money time, or effort.  The victimâ€™s family might disagree, but if the death penalty werenâ€™t an option in the first place, they wouldnâ€™t suffer any more.  They would simply have to live with someone living their life in prison- (if that is what the other option is, but that is a different debate.)
 The death penalty is a blessing to criminals and should be removed from the justice system completely. If an individual commits crimes knowing they may be put to death, what is to stop them from committing more and more crimes. It is better to have criminals serve out sentences with no chance of release. They are forced to live in prison for their whole lives, this can be many years. Why would we end their suffering sooner?
 The death penalty saves tax payers money.  Why should I pay for criminal's expenses instead of letting them die.  After all, most murders deserve death since they kill others.  We should execute more prisoners.
 I believe abortion should be legalized in every state across the world. It is a sin to believe that a person can just choose to let a pure innocent child die. God is watching always at the activities and decisions we humans make and God will surely see the horrible decisions those who choose to carry about abortion make. It is murder. Plain and simple. That child did nothing to deserve an untimely death before it has even had the chance to see the world.
 Capital punishment doesn't deter violent crimes. States with death penality do not show less murder rates. It's inhumane to delibertly kill another person, even within our court system. Some people never get a fair trial especial if they are of color and lack the funds for a decent lawyer.
 I think the government should ban abortions in the US.  It's an act of murder and that shouldn't be permitted.  There are many alternatives such as adoption and welfare to help women who aren't ready to be mothers.  Both our legal system and religious doctrines ban the murder of any individual and a fetus should not be exempt from these laws.
 I believe Abortion should be the right of the Woman! I do not believe the Government should ever make abortion illegal. There are so many factors that come into play when a woman get Pregnant.I truly believe that no one else but the woman should be able to decide what she does or does not do with her body.
 Abortion is a very touchy subject. I feel that if a person got raped, by some unknown person, or a family member, I would go forward with an abortion. I have some sense maybe of the living thing in me, but I would not want to bring someone into this world that I had to explain what happened, especially if it was a family member. That is so disgusting. The thought of a stranger, and you are not aware of their health, why would you want to jeopardize their life coming into the world with complications.
 The death penalty is quite effective in preventing crime. If people realize that the crime they commit may cost them their lives, they will think twice before committing the crime. It is also just that people that take a human life should surrender theirs as a punishment. Society needs to be paid for the actions of these criminals, so the death penalty is of benefit to society to exact justice.
 Zach Dyke is so funny. He is probably the funniest person I know. He is always coming up with the best jokes and is the life of the party everywhere he goes. He will help anyone out who is in need, and will always put others before himself. He is trustworthy, caring, and kind.
 The death penalty is wrong. It deprives a person of their most basic right, the right to life. We should instead try to reform these people. These people would suffer more, having time to consider their crimes while in prison for life.
 Abortion should not be allowed as it takes away the life of a child. The process of getting an abortion involves actually killing an unborn child, and this in itself is immoral. Women should not be able to decide whether or not they want to kill their unborn babies. It is not being against women's rights but being for human life.
 I think that it is inhumane to kill anyone - even people who have tortured and murdered others.  They have souls and it is possible for them to change their hearts.  They should be allowed to live comfortably in prison for the rest of their lives to think about what they have done.
 Abortion is the same as murder. As such it should be made illegal. An unborn child is the same as a baby so this over rules a woman's right to choose. We should make all abortion illegal because it is the equivalent of murder.
 I believe that it is not abortion that is the problem. The problem comes back to women's rights. A women should be able to make that decision for herself. It is not up to those outside of the situation to determine what she should do.
 Life begins at conception. As soon as those cells divide, it is a living being. t does not matter if it can survive outside the womb. Only God can decide to end a pregnancy early. Too many people us abortion as birth control.
 I think that the death penalty is kind of a stupid thing for the judicial system to do. Especially when they use it to kill people that are in jail for killing people. I just don't think that it accomplishes anything. Telling people that killing is wrong and then in turn punishing them by killing them, just doesn't accomplish anything in my book. I don't really thing there is any reason that we need to use the death penalty.
 I believe death penalty is necessary to prevent further crimes in the future and punish the killers. I believe our society needs to have this system in place, and that it will work and people will stop killing others a lot less. In the face of evil, the death penalty will always prevail and bring justice to the families of the victims.
 I believe abortion should be allowed with limited restriction. The only restriction I believe should be on fetal age (no abortions allowed after a certain number of weeks). There are too many unwanted children in this world and many of them will grow up in foster homes and foster care, which is not an environment that any child should have to endure. In addition, some pregnancies are caused by incest and rape, and a woman should have the right to decide whether to continue on with that pregnancy or not.
 I believe that human life begins at the moment of conception. So any attempt to end that life,even if it affects the life of the mother,is a crime. Like any other social issue, abortion has become very complex. When the abortion is performed has become a legal issue that will fluctuate from case to case. Just like capital punishment, opinions on abortion will be affected by circumstances.
 My friend is Sandy. Sandy was there when my relationship broke up. She lead me to the Lord which helped me understand what what happening in my life. She did not bail on me though when I thought spiritual things were absurd. Finally, I came around and she helped to guide me through the things that were important. She taught me to laugh again.
 Abortion is a very controversial topic, and rightly so, and yet most people probably have not thought out their opinions but base them on their gut reactions and preconceived notions. For example many people believe the Bible prohibits abortion, although their only evidence would be to recite the abbreviated commandment "thou shalt not kill". It is too easy to get an abortion and therefore it is used almost as a form of birth control. This cheapens the value of life. That is to say that the most important impact of abortion is the effect it has on society as a whole. What does it say about us that this can even rise to the level of a major and ongoing controversy? And yet I believe abortion is a matter of morality and you cannot legislate that.
 I think the abortion issue has been politicized as a "Right to Choose" for women. Right to choose? Choose what? The right to kill a human being that you don't want to bring into the world. And yes, any biology student knows life begins at conception. But what about the Father? Doesn't he have a say in this. Doesn't he have rights in this?Doesn't a Father to be have that right? I don't call the Democrats the "party of death" for nothing.
 The death penalty is a great idea. If a person has committed such a hateful crime to another individual then they should pay the ultimate sacrifice by giving up there own life in return. Anyone who has a loved one that as life has been wiped out by another person deserves justice. This justice should be by removing the life from the person that caused such pain and suffering. It is my belief that a person who has received the death penalty has done something so immoral that the possibilities of that person ever being productive in society is very low. They would be of no use to society and the chances are they have to values or morals and any thing short of the death penalty would make them a danger to society.
 I think abortion should be legal up to the third trimester.  It's a woman's right to choose whether or not she gives birth to the baby.  Also, Roe v. Wade federally stated that women reserve the right to an abortion.  However, at the third trimester the baby can basically be born, so I am against 3rd trimester abortion.  Before that, all abortions are, in my opinion, okay.
 My honest opinion about the death sentence is that I do not believe taking a person's life is right in any situation. Even though many believe "an eye for an eye"; many forget the last part "... makes the world blind." Given that a teaching of morality is learned when you learn to "treat those the way you want to be treated"; the "Golden Rule". I do not believe killing someone is the correct way to handle anything.
 I believe abortion is ok because it is simply a way of preventing an unwanted pregnancy.  A child is not viable outside the womb until the late stages of pregnancy and it can reasonably be argued that if life is not viable outside the womb, it is not a life with value and protection in and of itself.  It is not yet a separate and distinct entity. We have a clear standard in society for what does and does not constitute life.  As long as a woman carries a pregnancy and the fetus in the womb is not viable, it is still ultimately her decision as to whether she wants to carry this pregnancy in her body.  This is a decision that belongs only between a woman and her doctor.
 I do not agree with using the death penalty. If a person kills another human being, that person deserves to go to jail for the rest of his or her life. We are not the ones to judge and take justice out on the criminal; that is for God to do. We would have to forgive the criminal for his or her act, but never let him or her out in society again.
 I enjoy how spoiled this person is because it's adorable when she's throwing a fit about things that don't matter here in reality to normal not-rich people. I also like how she always dominates me about things she knows nothing about because I'm not good at being dominant and it feels good to be submissive. I like how passionate she is and how she can love me one day and hate me the next day and tell everyone else about it, but always lie to my face so I never have to worry about having my feelings hurt. I can tell her everything about me and I know she'll tell everyone about it so there's no worry about whether she will or not. She's funny sometimes.
 Abortion is a woman's right to choose her future.  It is a singular and internal decision to make.  Abortion should be legal.  Whether or not it is moral is up to the woman and no one else.
 Abortion is morally and religiously wrong.  If a woman is pregnant, it is clearly God's choice that she carry the baby to term.  Also, life begins at conception so on a moral ground abortion is 100% wrong and should be illegal.  Not to mention that some abortion facilities have shoddy practices and could potentially endanger a woman's life if she were to get an abortion there.  Coat hanger abortions should very easily cause a woman to die, along with the child if it were able to be born at the time of the abortion.
 Abortion should absolutely not be an option for pregnant mothers.  If a mother is pregnant, she must go through the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption if she does not want to take care of it.  If a woman's legs are open long enough to make a baby, they need to be open long enough to give birth to the baby.
 How would you feel if your loved one was brutally murdered? Most people would want to get closure, and the only way to do that would be to take "an eye for an eye". The man or woman who kills must realize the consequences of such a heinous action. If people truly know that they will get the death penalty, they will be deterred from killing in the first place and crime will decrease.
 I believe that it's a woman's right to choose whether she has an abortion.  I do not believe the government has the right to restrict a woman from having an abortion.  Abortion is a very hard decision that will affect the woman in many ways and only she is capable of determining what is right for her.  Although an abortion is a very unpleasant event, restricting a woman from having one could have even worse consequences.
 Abortion is simply a mother's choice about when she would like to have a baby. The fetus is not a human being, and if carried to term, would represent a hardship to the mother in one way or another, so it's entirely a woman's right to terminate the pregnancy if she so chooses.
 I've known my best friend about 10 months.  He is the kindest person I have ever met.  When he goes through a drive thru fast food restaurant, he worries that he didn't make enough small talk with the workers.  He encourages me in everything I do.  He inspired me to finish my degree.  He appreciates all the aspects of my personality I ever hoped someone would even notice.
 The death penalty is murder and an easy was to eliminate people who have made mistakes. The purpose of our criminal justice system is to rehabilitate people back into society, and by killing people for a mistake they made, that is not rehabilitation. While these people may not be able to be rehabilitated back into normal society, they could still do good on this planet and help other people not go down the same road.
 THe death penalty should absolutely stay. Some criminals, dangerous murderers, cannot ever be redeemed and why should the rest of us in the working world work to pay for them to be kept and given food and shelter? Death is not only beneficial for the working world but also for the dangerous criminals. Someone like that must be a bit of a tortured soul anyway and its almost a kindnes to them to put them to sleep.
 I believe abortion is wrong. A fetus should have a chance to live. Abortion is murder. God does not want us to murder.
 The death penalty is a very good tool for law enforcement. Most people will claim that it doesn't work due to crime rates don't drop because of it. I agree with it for different reasons. I think that people who are known to be menaces to society after using up their fifth chance should just be removed from the system. I hate sometimes looking up case searches on people and seeing they have been arrested and in altercations in the 30;s of times. That just shows me that this person is incorrigible and will never be a true and giving member of society. So why not remove them.
 I believe that abortion in some cases is positive thing.  Of course, in the case of rape or if the baby would be deformed or have no life quality it is acceptable.  I do not believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control, meaning that every "mistaken" pregancy can be dealt with with an abortion.  In some cases, extreme financial distress, perhaps it can be an alternative.
 He is not the most annoying person I know. His laugh is really cool. He smells good. I know he doesn't steal from people.
 I support the death penalty. Society kills people, even sacrificing its own, in war. Shying away from it would be insulting to me. God? Doesn't exist. It is not a moral question.
 I believe abortion is evil and murder.  It is clearly taking away a human life, and I imagine that anyone would want to live, if given a choice.  I believe that women are frivolous and cannot be trusted to make appropriate choices, therefore it is up to the lawmakers to ensure that these women make the correct choice.  Abortion should definitely be illegal, with stiff penalties for the woman who had the abortion, the doctor who performed it, and any other accomplices.  Penalties should be fines for the woman, and jail time or loss of license for the doctor.
 I am a true believer in what this country ws founded on and that is freedom and democracy and in order to maintain the integrity in those principles we must practice them daily.I personally prescribe to the pro choice mentality for that  exact reason.It is not my right to choose for others but to accept those choices weather i agree with them or not.T here many circumstances that individuals may choose to have an abortion and unless we accept that as their choice we will be set back into the dark ages socially where abortions are performed in back alleys without proper medical equipment and care.
 We talk frequently. Everything that happens in our lives we share. I would trust him with anything. He was just over last week.
 As a pro-choice advocate, I take the stand that women have the right to choose their futures, which includes deciding to have an abortion. I believe that abortion prevents a child from not being loved or being seen as a burden to their parent. I believe that there are too many children in the world who got stuck with a bad lot in life because their mother's selfishly brought a child in the world.
 I believe that the death penalty is a horrid thing! Killing people is never right no matter what they did! Honestly would you want someone to kill you because you made a mistake? What about your family?
 All my life I have been for the death penalty for capital cases. The older I get, the less I feel that way. Many people have been executed unjustly. Modern advances in DNA testing have proven people innocent years after the fact. The death penalty has absolute finality. Let's try to abolish it.
 I believe that abortion should be legal. The fact of the matter is that people are going to get abortions whether or not it is legal. The difference is that if they are illegal people are not going to receive them in a safe environment. Making abortions legal is pure and simple safer.
 My real opinion is that sometimes someone does things that are so horrible and heinous that the only way to bring about justice is to end their life.  Their death won't change the situation, but it will send a message that such things are not tolerated.  I feel that certain crimes are much more deserving of this (rape, premeditated murder, abuse that leads to the death of a child or animal) than others.
 I believe abortion is okay and is a valid option for some people.  That being said I believe it should be limited by how far along the pregnancy is, late stage abortions in my opinion are wrong.  Also abortion is an important option for those who have been raped.  I believe pregnancy should be prevented and can be easily prevented for those who wish to do so, that being said accidents do happen and an early abortion can be an option.
 The death penalty is horrible.  So many people get the death penalty that don't deserve it, it's disgusting.  I can't believe that some places allow you to go in and WATCH as it happens, this is appalling.  Humankind is disgusting.
 While the death penalty has been used in the United States for some time, there is no indication that is effectively reduces crime. In addition, nearly ever modern industrial nation has done away with this sort of punishment, leaving us as one of the few left practicing it. We need to join the modern world and work focus on solutions that solve problems, not ones that merely look good for show. Combine the fact that the punishment is inhumane and that there is a good chance that innocent people have been put to death under it for crimes they didn't commit, and anyone can clearly see that this punishment is not only ineffective, it has the potential to create additional long term problems regarding our values and ideals.
 I believe the death penalty should be used more often.  The men and women demented enough to commit horrible crimes do not deserve the luxury of living their lives with 3 meals and a place to sleep at the considerable expense of the taxpayer. The only concern I have with the death penalty is the sentencing of the wrongly convicted, or the people who are actually innocent but have been placed in a terrible position due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Therefore, I think that the penalty should be used every time there is overwhelming evidence that the accused committed the crime, such as there being video evidence with a clear image of the accused's face.  In it's current state, the death penalty exists with a large expense to the state, since appeals keep court costs high.  If overwhelming evidence is presented, that cost can be avoided.
 I feel like there is a time and place for the death penalty. I feel as if there is times where it may be needed. And times when it isnt. If the person just cannot absolutely changed from their habits that are making them be put up for the penalty then i agree with it. But I feel like there are also times when it wasnt needed. So I honestly believe it is needed but is also not needed in some cases.
 She looks good for her age. She always says what's on her mind and doesn't care what other people think. She dresses nicely for whatever occasion she attends and is always on time. She gives nice gifts on holidays, that are appropriate for everyone. She supports her family financially and is very attentive to her parents' needs.
 This person knows exactly what makes me happy and what makes me sad. They are always there to listen and lend advice, while also accepting my screw ups when I don't utilize their advice. They never let me feel alone and know they can confide in me anything. This person and I won't ever leave each other's friendship as it is more valuable than anything that could come between it.
 The state has no right to kill its citizens. Period. It is an irreversible punishment. Vengeance might feel good, but it accomplishes nothing. The fear of death doesn't dissuade anyone from murder.
 A woman has the right to choose what happens to her own body. If she does not want a child it is her choice. Others, should not have a say in what happens to someone else's body. If the pregnancy is not in line with the woman's plan, she has the right to end it.
 It is a woman's choice on what she does with her body. Having a child may not be the best situation for a woman or the child if she is not emotionally or financially able to care for the child. Having a child young could be unhealthy for the mother and child. Unwanted pregnancies cost the state a great deal of money.If you can't take care of the child everyone suffers.
 Abortion is murder, and it should be banned in all cases. Millions of babies have been murdered for the convenience of loose women. We must eradicate this scourge on our society. God will judge us according to our deeds.
 I believe that abortion is wrong except when the mothers life is in danger. A fetus is a person and it is wrong to kill it  for no reason. If people don't want a baby, then don't have sex. Don't end someone else's life because you made a stupid choice.
 Wow, That is pretty radical. Doesn't seem coldhearted to say some people are just wastes of space. I don't believe their mother, friends or siblings believe that. I understand where you are coming from but there is no lesson learned in death. It just ends the student. I can't see any excuse where we would give up on human life like that.
 The death penalty should only be used for situations involving murder or rape.  The person accused should be innocent until proven guilty.  The death penalty for crimes like robbery or tax fraud should only result in fines or prison time.  The death penalty should be used wisely and not too often.  Basically, if the person raped or murdered someone with evil motives or in a torturesome way, they deserve the death penalty.
 I do not know if abortion is good or bad, but I believe the woman has a choice. The world is over populated and raising a child is never a easy thing, not to mention it changes the woman or couples live. The person can get on with their lives, hopefully their dreams without the strain have a child may provide. It could even help with stem cell research to help others.
 The death penalty is awful. Everybody should be given a second chance. Committing murders is usually linked with mental illness, which everybody should be treated for everywhere. If a person really wants to kill, he should be sent to the army or a place where his "talents" can be used. This isn't the stone age, where an arm for an arm and a leg for a leg is a death for a death.
 I think that abortion is not a pleasant issue, but I believe that women should have abortion available to them as an option. Many pro-life activists demonize women in their pursuit to have abortion illegalized, which I think is awful. Many women have a good reason to wish to obtain an abortion, and men are just as guilty in this as are women. I believe abortion puts power in the hands of women, which is crucial in our patriarchal society. I think abortion should be kept legal except in the cases of late-term or partial-birth abortions, which are cruel and unnecessary. As a way to limit abortions, I think birth control should be universally accessible to all women and that sex education programs should be taught to all young adults, starting in 5th or 6th grade before kids become sexually active.
 I believe it is ok to have an abortion. That you wouldnâ€™t be judged by people who donâ€™t believe this issue is right. I think that everyone should support a woman that wants an abortion regardless of their personal beliefs. I think Christians ran businesses should not complain about having to provide coverage for abortion in an insurance policy.
 I believe that every person carrying a child who wishes to have an abortion should be able to have an abortion. I think that what someone wants to do with their body is their business and their business only. Forcing someone to carry a child that they do not want for 9 months is cruel and absurd. A young fetus is not capable of feelings and is simply a growth in the body.
 The value of human life is too precious to throw away so callously.  There is no difference between the crime committed by the accused and the government system that carries out the death penalty.  Murder is still murder even if it is in the name of justice. Prison does enough to isolate the criminals from society, and allows the everyday citizen to feel safe without resorting to governmental and systematic slaughter.
 The death penalty is a necessary practice. It provides justice and a sense of closure for grieving families of victims. It is only reserved for the vilest criminals. There is no purpose in keeping such evil people alive- it is simply a drain on taxpayer dollars to continually feed someone that has demonstrated any lack of morality or self-control. There is a growing problem with prison overcrowding as it is. There is simply no reason to keep certain criminals alive.
 The death penalty should be left intact.  Why should the citizens pay their hard earn taxes for criminals to live? That money could be better spent elsewhere such as schools or hospitals. The money could be better spent on bettering the community instead of housing more criminals that contribute nothing to society.
 I am pro choice.  I believe that a woman should always have the choice to what happens to her own body, therefore she should be the only person to decide weather to carry a baby to term. I don't think the unborn have a right to decide after all they have not been born yet.  The most important to consider is the woman and if she WANTS a child.
 I think abortion is an abomination! The people that are willing to kills their children, Gods creations! It is absolutely disgusting! We must not let these liberal dogs run rampant killing our innocent children. There is no question what a moral individual would vote for in this topic. Vote for the right choice. Life.
 The death penalty is a cruelty that needs to be abolished. Supposedly lethal injection is painless, but often the victims of this horrendous practice convulse in pain before their demise. Sometimes even a second injection must be made to actually achieve the desired result. This is a remnant of medieval torture that is somehow allowed to remain in the civilized world despite it's awful cruelty and needs to end.
 My best friend who is also my girlfriend/fiance and she is amazing and absolutely beautiful.  I would spend everyday with her for the rest of my life.  Her smile is radiant and she lights up the room. I love her personality and she makes me very happy and I feel unconditionally loved by her.
 My belief is that the death penalty should be enforced. This is because people ought to be afraid of the consequences of their wrongdoings. Lots of individuals do not fear simply going to jail and observe such punishments as merely "a slap on the wrist". Lots of times, since jailtime is not feared, the perpetrator of crimes will recidivate back to their old ways and others will see that there isn't much of an enforcement against crimes. Put short, people fear death, and only death.
 The death penalty should be used more often. It is an effective deterrent to crime. If you are serving a life sentence or perpetrate a heinous crime, you should be responsible with your life. I think more prisoners need to face this charge and be put to death. It will also save taxpayers thousands of dollars and reduce prison overcrowding.
 I believe that the death penalty is just if it fits the crime. Some crimes are so haneous that this is the only way to justify what has happened. Some criminals wish they had the death penalty because it would act as a way out for them. I believe it can be used however, it must be used right.
 I think that an individual's opinion on abortion should not dictate societal and legal stances on abortion.  Every situation is different, and while many other options are preferable, there are some cases where abortion is acceptable, recommended, or even the best option available.  I think it is up to the mother with child to determine the best course of events for her situation.  The act of shaming this choice leads to more harm than good.
 I believe that the death penalty is the best solution to resolving a criminal of a hideous crime of murder, or rape and sometimes for repetitive offenders of crimes. I think that noone deserves to live if they kill another person; and the simplest and effective way to solve this problem is to exterminate the problem. I agree that there is no "teaching an old dog new tricks" and think it's unfair to the taxpayers to support criminals who are being held for life in prison. I'm one for all to ending it with a humane way of resolving things and the death penalty is the way to go!
 I do not believe in abortion.I had an abortion when i was 16 and it was a very emotional experience for me. I believe abortion to be murder because the fetus has a heart that beats,while inside the womb.After the fourth month,a mother can feel it moving inside her,some have been seen in ultrasound sucking their thumbs. I believe life begins at conception because if the fetus doesn't get the nutrients from the mother while in the womb,it will die.
 I don't think there should be a death penalty.  Death is final; if other evidence is discovered 5 or so years down the road that proves the defendant was innocent, it is too late.  Then, too, it seems that the poorer defendants have a better chance of being convicted than the ones who can afford a top-notch lawyer.  I don't think it's ever right to kill another person.
 All human life is precious.  No one should ever abort a fetus for any reason.  There are always people out there waiting to adopt a beautiful baby.  So no matter what the situation, abortion is always wrong.
 The child is the most important thing. Abortion is murder. If you have an abortion you will go to hell. Abortions takes children away from adoptive parents.
 He's Trustworthy and not manipulative. great guy around kids. Awesome hair. Not an Ass. No one has a reason to hate him
 People that murder people with premeditation deserve the death penalty because they are a clear threat to citizens and inmates lives.  If they are released at some point they may re-offend.  It is better that they die, than another victim.  If they go to prison, they may kill other inmates or guards.  It is better that this murderer die than those other inmates or guards.  In addition, the expense of housing an inmate who commits this offense for the rest of their lives is close to a million dollars.  The public shouldn't be expected to pay for his offense.
 I believe that abortion should be legal. Women deserve a right to their own body. Men should not be the ones who decide wether or not a woman has the right to abort her child. Abortion is the best option for some women whether it's because of rape or she got pregnant at a young age.  Sometimes it is better to abort a baby than have it be born into a terrible life.  Furthermore, if abortion is illegal then people will find other ways to abort their child. Also, if a women is forced to have her own child then men should be forced to stick around as well.
 My friendship with my best friend has lasted 22 years. We have a great time together going for walks and rearranging peoples yard decorations and walking in the rain splashing each other. We got along so well we ended up getting married just before our second child was born. we have been through it all from being poor to having a decent income back to being poor again. Through it all we have stood by each others side. I would not trade my best friend for anything in the world.
 No one should be able to tell someone what they can & cannot do with their own body.  If a woman wishes to have an abortion she should be allowed to make this decision of her own free will without persecution.  It is not a black and white issue.  Abortion is not murder.
 I think the problem is not with the death penalty, but it is with the legal system who sometimes ignores facts and innocent people are killed.  However, I am for the death penalty. In fact I'm for an even greater measure. If some one breaks into someone's home and brutally rapes, tortures, and then kills someone or a group of people - I believe that person should feel pain when they die.  They caused so much hurt and anguish I think they deserve a little bit of that.
 My best friend Jessica has been there since I was 9. We always do something fun, whether it's going out or staying in. We are always texting funny things to each other. She is coming tomorrow to go to a concert with me.
 To believe that repaying a murder with a murder is archaic. The death penalty in it's most simple nature is murder. The death penalty creates an environment where people can believe that in certain cases it is right to take a life and that you can make that decision. A better approach would be to rehabilitate a murder and return them as a productive member to society. This would teach that we all have a redeeming quality and would develop an environment that encourages people to find the good in one another and work through issues that they may have.
 I believe that under no circumstances, should an abortion be allowed, as life is a gift from God and we are given souls at conception. Regardless of circumstance a woman (including rape victims), should give birth to the child as itâ€™s not that childâ€™s fault.  They can always give the child to an adoption agency if they donâ€™t want it. Anybody considering abortion should look at themselves in a mirror and ask what if my parents had done the same.
 The death penalty is not an effective deterrent against crime. The reasons for this vary. The main reason the death penalty is not a deterrent against crime is that people believe that they will not be caught. Another reason it does not prevent crime is that people know that the appeals process takes a very long time, and they might not ever be put to death. Another reason is that people feel that even if they are caught and sentenced, they will be pardoned, and never put to death.
 Abortion is perfectly fine in any and all situations. A woman has sole rights to do what she wants with her body. A fetus is just a fetus and not a human being. If a woman is ready to be a mother, then she will choose to give birth. Religious activists often fight against abortion, however God provided physicians with this knowledge to perform abortions, therefor it must be right!
 My best friend's name is Silas. We met our first year at college and became fast friends. We had some of the same classes and were both very interested in music. Music really brought us together and we even played in a band for a while. We no longer play music together, but still get along very well and see each other pretty regularly. Even though we don't play in a band anymore, we still are both very passionate about music and see each other a lot at the same shows and concerts.
 I believe the death penalty should only be reserved for the most heinous and cruel acts of murder, and where more than 2 people were murdered. For most people, including murderers, they should spend the rest of their lives behind bars and not face death penalty. I will ultimately tend to favor over no death penalty.
 The people that oppose the death penalty have clearly never looked into the eyes of the victims of these criminals. Without the death penalty how can we tell them that justice has truly been carried out? In our state we should make it absolutely clear that we abhor these crimes. What better way to deter the criminal element than death? They may be able to make friends in prison, even thrive depending on their connections, but you cannot bargain or adjust to death.
 My view on the death penalty is that it is bad. Despite its means of severely punishing people that have committed severe crimes, the death penalty takes forever to commence. Many criminals on death row barley suffer and live and eat on tax payers money. Criminals should instead be sent to harsh punishment, where their actions will shed light on the dire consequences.
 I believe that abortion is important to every woman, its her choice what she does with her body. If a woman feels that she can't handle a baby then its her choice what she does with the baby. If a woman is raped or can't have a baby because it could hurt her then she should be able to have an abortion. It's not right for a woman to be told what she can't or can do with her body its her choice and her choice alone.
 The death penalty is counter productive to justice.  It's a way out for severe criminals.  Our prison system is ruthless and bleak.  People who commit severe crimes deserve to suffer in these conditions.  We should not liberate them through death.
 Even before it is born, a child is a separate person, entitled to all the rights of other living human beings. Its unique DNA and personhood make it separate from the mother, who has no right to judge whether the child lives or dies. Once a child is conceived, it is the duty of the mother and society to protect it. If the birth parents cannot take care of the child, adoption is the more preferable option.
 Abortion is evil and should never be allowed. Those who perform or receive them should be counted as murderers. Since the government is way too liberal it is up to us to enforce God's will. We must stop at nothing to make sure that this establishment cannot stand.
 I don't see too many things wrong with it. I think certain crimes deserve the most severe of punishments. I do think the victims' families should have a say in whether the person should be forgiven or not though. I think that since they are the ones mostly seeking justice, they should be able to prevent the death penalty from being carried out. I also think that the standard of evidence should be absolutely clear and very high.
 Abortion should be every woman's right.  Pregnancy and subsequent motherhood take an extreme toll on women that should not be forced on anyone who is unwilling.  Further, the effects of children born to parents who are unwilling or unable to meet parenthood ability are sad and society has no good solutions for this circumstances.  Sometimes the most humane thing for all involved is to terminate a pregnancy.
 I believe abortion should be legalized.  There are situations where it would be beneficial for the mother to have one.  For example, if giving birth threatens her life, she should have the option to abort.  There are also situations where a woman is unfit to be a mother, possibly causing the unborn child future suffering.
 I believe that abortion should be legal and safe, but I also believe that alternatives should be encouraged. If abortion is illegal, women will still seek out ways to make the fetus go away. This results in many dangerous acts that threaten the life of the woman. In short, I believe that abortion should be legal, but rare.
 Abortion is wrong. The minute a pregnancy is achieved, there is a life. If a woman makes the decision to have sex she should be prepared to deal with the consequences. Even if, the woman does not want a child there are many options such as adoption available. It is not right that a child be killed because a pregnancy is not convenient for the mother.
 I believe the death penalty is absolutely necessary in some criminal cases, such as murder. When taking someone elses life with intent, it is only fair that the price you pay is your own. That victim will never get their life back, so why should the perpetrator still have theirs? It is simply based on fairness and an "eye for an eye" belief. I also believe it to be beneficial to society in that most people would think twice about murder considering the fact they know if they are caught, they will pay with their own life.
 Women should have the right to choose what happens with their own bodies and how they live their lives.  Pregnancy and childbirth are opportunities only provided to women and women should be able to control what happens to themselves.  Accidental pregnancies do happen.  As long as abortions are done in the early weeks of pregnancy, prior to full development, women should be able to choose whether or not they carry the baby to term.
 Murder is a sin and abortion is murder.  For that reason abortion should be illegal.  Every life matters and an unborn child should not be punished for the selfishness of their mother.  There are always alternatives to abortion, including adoption.  It would be best if those who are unfit to be parents completed the pregnancy and gave their children up for adoption.
 Abortion is a woman's rightful choice.  It would affect her body, and she is the only one who owns her body.  Women should not be ridiculed for making the decision to have an abortion because it is each woman's right to protect her body, and not every woman who considers abortion goes through with it, but each and every woman should be allowed the choice.
 I believe that a women has the right to do whatever she wants with her body.  Going through with an abortion is not a matter of which men can make a decision on, nor anyone else except that woman.  There are many instances when an abortion is appropriate, such as in cases of rape, or when a contraceptive fails.  I believe it always better to abort a fetus then to have a child you are not ready for or cannot care for.
 my little brother. they are so cool. they are so laid back and like to smoke pot all the time. they are so cool i love they just chill out all the time and don't do anything.
 The death penalty is definitely one punishment that should be carried out in several situations.  First of all, you get rid of a dangerous criminal without needing to spend the money to educate him/her.  It also sets an example which can help control the lower class people.  It shows that if you commit a terrible crime, you will die for it.  As a deterrent AND a punishment, the death penalty is, by far, an all-in-one type deal.
 I am ok with the death penalty in cases where the person being put to death has been proven to deserve it. I have always been a firm believer in an eye for an eye. I also believer that the person being put to death should be done so immediately and not given however many years of room and board while they wait. And the final act should be done so as cheaply as possible.
 I enjoy having sex with others, and having to go to the abortion clinic every two months to have the fetus removed. I want no children. I don't want to have to raise little babies that cry. So I know I will get pregnant each time, but I'm heading straight to the clinic and having my abortion. I don't care what it does to my body, I just want to get rid of the thing.
 Sometimes, there are those who commit crimes so heinous that there is only one appropriate punishment. That punishment is death. Some would point to wrongful convictions and say that we should abolish the death penalty. I would say that we need to be judicious in our use of it. However, there is room for its use.
 Without the death penalty either or right or wrong you would have even more crime. Without a effective deterrent that even frightens people then you will ultimately just have a society that is about chaos instead of law and order. To keep other people from killing each other sometimes you have to have very severe consequences. You have to make people pause before they ever even dare think about taking another human beings life. Fear is sometimes unfortunately necessary to teach people right or wrong. You take a life you lose your life is the saying that is used and in some cases it is necessary.
 Any chance the accused, no matter how small, is innocent means they should not be executed. Juries can be wrong. Life imprisonment is no picnic either, and that would be plenty of punishment, IMO. Maybe doing the execution promotes violence, saying the state can kill, and in some cases killing is OK. Is the reason to execute just vengeance? May not be enough, if you think about it.  Actually cheaper to do life imprisonment, instead of the never ending appeals. And the studies show the DP does not deter others from crimes.
 This person is nice, and we do fun things. He's always around when I need him. We like to go out to the bar. We are always together.
 People have sex. That's the leading cause of how people get here. Until recent years and the advent of the condom, when people had sex, they had children whether they wanted them or not. If a family couldn't afford to feed/clothe them, they had them anyhow. If the mother was of poor health, she became pregnant. I should mention at this point that in many time periods women did not have a choice when it came to sex; they were at the whim of the man and so regardless of family resources or the woman's health, children were birthed. Infant mortality rates were very high, and many women died while giving birth. We can, and have, avoided risky pregnancies, pregnancy due to unwanted sex, children who cannot have proper resources and the transmission of STDs by the use of birth control pills and condoms. Abortion is simply one more way we can avoid children who cannot be provided for; the eventual outcome of many being another member of a poor, uneducated class who ironically do not have resources to raise children nor access to birth control.
 Candice is my best friend because she puts out and doesn't even expect a relationship. I can just come knocking on her door and she'll put out for me.
 I believe that the death penalty should be legalized. On moral ground, if a person is proven without a doubt to have committed murder (and has not been diagnosed as mentally disturbed), he/she should receive maximum punishment. In my opinion, life in prison is not enough punishment. The guilty party ended someone's life; an eye for an eye is only fair. Additionally, time is prison means that tax payers are supporting the criminal, which is unfair.
 The death penalty is inhumane and must be outlawed. Supporters of the death penalty believe that it is cheaper than a life sentence. However, this is incorrect. The cost spent to prepare for a lethal injection is moderately more expensive.
 The death penalty is more about revenge than justice. I also believe that when a government by the people kills someone, then it's as if everyone is responsible for that person's execution. I am not comfortable with this. Further, studies have shown that the death penalty has been used in wrong conviction cases and that there is a racial bias in those put to death. I believe that no person's life is worth less than another's, and that an act of violence should not be answered with another act of violence. It has been proven that the death penalty is not a deterrent.
 Abortion should be allowed. It is the woman's choice.   There are always special cercumstances in which abortion should be expected, such as if the mother was raped, or if the child's birth will cause serious risk to the mother, or if the child is deemed to come out with severs birth defects. It most certainly should not be used as a form of birth control, and there should be a strict limit on how many one can ahve in her lifetime.
 Abortion should be made illegal because it is taking a human life. Our laws restrict against killing another human being and it should be enforced to protect a human being even if it is in the womb. Allowing for woman to proceed with abortion is saying certain human life is valuable instead of that all human life is valuable. Does that human baby not have rights too? Allowing for abortion also allows for women to make poor decisions and then legally take the life of an innocent person who is not her own. She may have the right to make decisions for herself, but not for a second individual that is the infant.
 I believe abortion is a woman's choice. People abuse their bodies all the time yet it's never an issue. When someone wants to take their kidney out, no one fusses. I truly believe in choice for an individual, and abortion is definitely one of them.
 My brother has helped me the past two years in finding a safe place to live.  He was refurbishing a house in Florida and had to move to California.  I was on the verge of being homeless.  He let me stay in the home, continuing to pay the expenses, while I tried to find some work in the area.  I maintained the yard and continued the rehab of the house.  I would do anything possible given the occasion to help him out.
 The death penalty is complicated. In a perfect world, I would support the death penalty. I believe that there are some crimes that are so heinous that the criminal cannot be re-introduced into society. As such, he or she is a burden to society and should just be killed. However, because our justice system is not perfect, I disagree with the death penalty. Too many innocents can be put to death. The costs outweigh the benefits.
 My reason for being against abortion is simply that it is cold blooded murder.  A baby can be aborted well after it has established a heart beat.  It is a living human being from the moment of conception.  Over 1,000,000 soldiers have died fighting in wars for the United States.  Since 1972, there have been over 50,000,000 abortions.  This is truly a form of genocide in today's world that is allowed without blinking an eye.  Anyone who has watched a video of an abortion and seen the baby try to run from the killing tools will know that this is a form of murder that is completely allowed and even pushed by many people in this country today.
 Abortion is a choice. It should be made by both parties if possible, but the woman should have final say if there is disagreement. I think that with counseling, and all the other options available, it is not morally wrong for a woman to choose to have an abortion. A fetus is not viable outside the womb before 26 weeks, and then only barely, and with very expensive care.
 I like how this person takes time and does not start drama. I like how this person  treats her friends. Her daughter is a saint and never is mean to animals. She never tells lies. She never dates peoples husbands.
 I don't think it's bad.  The baby isn't actually living until it is born to me.  I wouldn't want to get an abortion, but I have no problem with people who do.  It's their issue.
 Once conceived, the baby inside your womb is no longer a part of just you, it is a creation of a new life.  The DNA is not an exact replication of you but is of that as an entirely unique individual from the moment of conception.  As you would not kill another member of society, you also do not have the right to estinquish this new life from entering the world.  There are so many choices that you should consider when you find out that you are carrying a new life.  So many couples want children and are not able to conceive one of their own.  If you are not ready to handle the responsibilities of parenthood consider giving the gift of life to another who so desperately wants to raise a child.
 I think that abortion is the mother's choice. She is in control of her own body. If she does not want a baby to grow inside of it, no one should be able to force her to do so. An embryo at a very early stage has not developed a personality. Hopefully, they have little or no awareness and will feel little or no pain. So, if the pregnancy is terminated it will be as if the embryo never existed. This is better than bringing a baby into the world that is abnormal, unwanted, or to a mother that is incapable of taking care of it.
 Abortion can be a good solution to a problem pregnancy.  If a woman has been raped and became pregnant, she would not want to deliver the baby which would always be a constant reminder of the rape.  Also, single mothers sometimes are not capable of taking care of a tiny infant and the better choice would be to abort.  Then if the life of the mother was in jeopardy, the fetus also should be aborted to save the mother's life.
 Abortion should be a legal option for pregnant mothers.  Of course, it needs to be very early in the pregnancy and the mother must give significant consideration to other options.  Abortion must be legal, or these mothers will resort to other more horrific and harmful ways to end a pregnancy.  I don't believe any mother EVER wants to have to make the decision to abort, but the option must be available for the safety of mothers who cannot bear a child for one reason or another.
 I personally donâ€™t believe in abortion and would never have one. I also believe that god gave us free will. If someone wants to have an abortion, it is their right to have one. However, I donâ€™t believe that religious companies should have to provide insurance that will allow a woman to have an abortion. They should have a private insurance that covers abortions just like they have car insurance. Therefore, those who want to do these can be covered.
 I have gone back and forth with my side on abortion but I have decided that I am pro-choice. If a woman is raped or incest is involved I understand why women would want to get rid of a child. I think people do not understand that it's different if you are in the situation.
 My best friend is my romantic partner. We've been together for over four years and do everything together. We are such good friends because we tell each other everything and spend all free time together. We bought a dog together and are raising her like "our" child (since we can't have children). We enjoy similar activities and spend a lot of time talking about our shared hobbies or our goals for life. I love him and know I'd be heart-broken without him in my life. He matters more to me any anyone.
 I believe it is a person's own choice to do with their body what they wish. If a woman is pregnant and wishes to abort the child then it is up to her wither or not to do so. Most abortions have been proven safe under proper medical supervision and legal under a certain amount of time; therefore it is not my place to tell another woman what to do with her body. Especially when (assuming her choice is to abort)the procedure under question is both safe (for her) and legal.
 I truly support the death penalty. I feel that some acts committed by humans are just so heinous that they do not deserve to experience life any longer. I also feel that in the most heinous cases, the evidence is overwhelming enough to convict a person of the crime. Humans are responsible for a natural moral code. In the most extreme violations of this code, those that cannot follow it should pay with their lives. It benefits no one but the criminal in question to allow them to live. They would only continue to burden society if they were simply put in jail to serve a sentence.
 I personally believe abortion is wrong.  It is against my religious beliefs.  I feel it is murder.  God gives life and God is the only one to take it away.  How would you feel if your Mother aborted you!! People have choices and they choose to abort or to give life.  If you don't want the child there are plenty other willing parents to take a raise yours.
 Abortion should be considered a complete disregard for life.  Life begins at conception and to take a life of a child is a unlawful and full of sin no matter what the age.  People don't know what is best for them in a stressful situation, and when a person is considering abortion, they are not able to think straight about what they are truly doing to an unborn living human being.  A child is a gift to the world and should be treated as such with all the same consideration ever other human being gets.
 I do not like the use of the death penalty.  As human beings, we are not given the authority to judge someone else's behavior to the point of death.  We are not the ones who should be decide when or where someone dies.  Just as the person on death row should not have made that decision for someone else.  If we kill them, that does not make us better, it puts us at their level.
 I believe that everyone should receive mercy and that should be released from the death penalty. That killing the murders is wrong and killing them is the easy way out for them. We should let them all live out their days in prison. We as a human race are better than to kill people.
 I believe that taking a life, no matter how awful the crimes are is wrong. Each person is placed on this planted for a reason and to take that person off the planet is wrong. No matter what, a person deserves to live a life even if it is behind bars. Sometimes people are accused of crimes that they did not commit and if they are put to death then that would be considered murder.
 I believe that abortion is a bad thing. For one, the baby has a life, and should not be able to decide for it whether or not it can live or not. Also, the baby can not make the decision on its own. If the mom does not want the baby, she could easily give it up for adoption. Some one out there would want to adopt the baby.
 Many young women find themselves in bad situations when they end up with an unwanted pregnancy.  These women do not have the means and family support to help them raise a child on their own.  A lot of these children can end up being dysfunctional, creating a larger drain on our society.  Therefore, it is necessary to give women the option of terminating their pregnancy.
 The death penalty is a necessary tool of punishment for individuals who have committed crimes so heinous and vicious that they can no longer be spared life in the physical world. If a person admits to killing several people he should get the death penalty. If a person commits violent crime after crime, he or she should get the death penalty. Death penalty helps keep evil from multiplying.
 I believe any one who gets knocked up and knows they don't wanna ever have kids in life should get abortions anytime they have un protected sex with countless partners.They shouldn't be responsible for there actions.
 I think a woamn has the right to choose the fate of her unborn child because it is a private issue and it is her body. People make mistakes and if a woman makes the mistake of an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to end that pregnancy. Years ago, woman didn't have that right and abortions were a very risky thing to do by yourself. Many women died trying. Not only that but finding a Doctor to before an abortion was very hush, hush. They were hard to find. Now it can be done in medical clinics specializing in abortions and its done in a very dignified way. Women should be so lucky.
 My co-worker and I get along so well at work. He always shows up in time and shares the load of work evenly. Whenever there is a problem, we both work together to resolve it as fast as possible. I get a call from him every time he is going to be late to work, that way I know he will be a few minutes late. We hang out and talk about work in our free time.
