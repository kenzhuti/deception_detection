"Zayn on Taylor Swift: ""I Think She Deserves Her Success""
","Perhaps more than any other celebrity, Ms. Jolie, 42, has kept herself firmly planted in two vastly different worlds. She’s both the glamorous A-lister whose every move is tracked in headlines (“Angie and the kids left Target because it didn’t serve hot dogs,” read one recent newsflash), and the humanitarian do-gooder who has made more than 60 trips to the field as part of her United Nations work. Apparent contradictions account for her elusive allure. Ms. Jolie has been enduringly hard to peg, a woman who cannot easily be lumped into a single category because she occupies many at once.

She has a meticulously managed public profile yet professes not to care what others think. She remains near the pinnacle of celebrity’s cruel pyramid, even though her recent movies only made money when she was camouflaged (“Maleficent,” “Kung Fu Panda”). She is obsessed over — if, in the United States at least, not exactly beloved — and fixed in the cultural firmament as America’s vixen despite having a half-dozen-strong brood.

Three of the four movies she has made are set in wartime, including her latest, “First They Killed My Father,” based on the true story of Loung Ung, who as a young girl survived the Cambodian genocide and is now one of Ms. Jolie’s close friends.

","Ms. Jolie has an indelible connection to Cambodia, not least because it completely reordered her life.

She also got publicly hot and heavy with her second husband, Billy Bob Thornton, and wore a locket with droplets of his blood around her neck.

","Here’s who it seems the boys of 1D are modelling themselves after. Whether they’re succeeding is another thing entirely.
",celebrity,0
"Lindsay Lohan talks drugs, booze, rehab, sex
","Since he quit the band long before the boys called a hiatus, it’s not surprising that the singer’s debut (Mind of Mine, released in March 2016) seemed to dramatically strive to establish itself as the musical antithesis of One Direction. Between interviews that saw Zayn slagging off the band and his aesthetic rebrand that saw him secure a collaboration with Donatella Versace, Malik seemed keen to distance himself from the artist he used to be in the most dramatic sense.
",celebrity,0
"Beyoncé and Jay Z welcome twins
","Which explains why he took the Abel Tesfaye road of singing about sex, drugs, and a combination of the two. But where the Weeknd took years to earn mainstream recognition (and worked his way through the industry), Zayn’s fanbase was already built in – which is why his rejection of One Direction seemed particularly harsh. So while Malik is a smart, talented, and multi-dimensional person, his debut lacked the authenticity that defines his fellow R&B artists. Not that he can’t come back from that: having spent the past year opening up about his anxiety and keeping his head down, he could emerge for his sophomore effort as a grown-ass man, aware that the best artists are the sum of all parts – boy bands and all.

"Prince William & Kate Attend First Royal Garden Party of the Season
","With Harry, it’s a toss-up between Bowie and Jagger and even Robbie Williams – particularly when you consider the sweeping nature of Styles’ first single, Sign of the Times. (Enter: Millennium.) But thanks to tracks including Carolina, Woman, and even Kiwi, the future Dunkirk star seems to have modelled his full-length debut after the expansive nature of Jagger and co – at least if you take into account how varied the Rolling Stones discography gets after leaping away from garage rock.
",celebrity,0
"Rosie O'Donnell Sells Her Star Island Mansion for $16.5 Million
","Which is something Styles seems to have emulated and recognized, from his stage presence (which he showed off on James Corden’s Late Late Show all week) to his sense of fashion to the way his album reads like a generous tribute to British rock. No two songs are the same, nor are two tempos. Like Jagger, the singer sings primarily about women, his complicated relationship with them, and the experiences that come with being a young man. What will be interesting is whether he reinvents himself similarly as his career continues – dance moves and all.
",celebrity,0
"George, Amal Clooney donate $1M to Southern Poverty Law Center to combat hate groups
","Is this a stretch? Absolutely. But because Just Hold On saw Louis collaborate with Steve Aoki and do his own singing, it seemed the 1D alum was channeling 2017-era Harris (who’s been singing his own songs) while simultaneously maintaining the DJ’s long legacy of working with big names.
",celebrity,0
"Why Can't Jessie J Be Bi?
","It’s still a generous likening, especially since Louis has only delivered one track with no announcement of a forthcoming full-length. But that could also be a strategy: where his compadres are actively working the circuit, Tomlinson seems content to drop a banger every so often, leaving fans to thirst after him, instead of vice versa. His longevity, however, will depend on whether he gets behind the production board or begins working the DJ booth. Because as great as Calvin’s Harris’ vocals are, I don’t think any of us need entire albums of them.

"Khloe Kardashian Shares Cute Photo With 'Precious' Niece Dream
","Like Bieber via 2012’s Believe, Slow Hands reintroduced Horan to his fans as an adult. But where Zayn used shock tactics to differentiate himself from his past, Niall borrowed from the pages of Bieber’s book, and used his songwriting to prove he wasn’t just some dude with an acoustic guitar. He could sing well, he could creatively adapt for a grown-up solo venture, and he still cherished his existing fan base and the legacy of his former self. Which Justin did, once upon a time, too: while Bieber leapt from child prodigy to rebel without a cause, his musical evolution never really faltered, and his career was kept afloat by the legacy he refused to condemn or distance himself from. So if Niall considers himself another Bieber, that would be brilliant: he would arguably be setting himself up for even bigger and better success, fortunately too old to relive Justin’s 2013 ventures.

","I ... don’t know, you guys.

The thing is, Sheeran and Jonas have both mastered their art by making songs seem sincere or as part of an in-joke with their audiences – they’re not delivered on a platform built to broadcast their own greatness.

I believe that peace lies beyond personalities, beyond invention and disguise, beyond the red ‘S’ that you wear on your chest, that makes bullets bounce off. I believe that it’s deeper than that. I believe we’re a field of energy dancing for itself, and—uh—I don’t care.” (It wasn’t exactly extemporaneous poetry; the lines are borrowed from a commencement speech he gave in 2014 at Iowa’s Maharishi University of Management).

","Yes, he sounded like a liberal-arts student on a particularly mellow week night. And it’s not clear whether he sensed the irony in himself saying all of that while attending the party and wearing a flashy tailored suit (Asked about his get-up, he said, “I didn’t get dressed up. There is no me. There’s just things happening.”).

","Carrey’s referendum, despite its slightly unbearable pitch, rings somewhat true amid the backdrop of destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. And Charlottesville. And the general mood of melancholy that has settled over the country like a thick fog. It’s hard to see where the art and commercialism and spectacle of N.Y.F.W. fits into all that. Designers themselves have struggled with that question since the 2016 election, as have many creators in other fields. The world looks different now than it did even last February, and it will somersault a thousand more times before the clothing parade gears again up next February. (But, make no mistake, the parade will go on.)

","While many of Selena's fans expressed their excitement on social media for the newest addition to her family, others were disappointed because they're assuming she chose to purchase the dog from a pet store, many of which are notorious for selling puppies raised in unethical puppy mills , rather than adopting one from a shelter. ""Why buy instead of adopting this makes me so mad,"" one Twitter user wrote . In an Instagram comment screenshot by another Insta user, one person wrote , ""I also can't believe you would buy a puppy from the pet stores that are breeding and putting animals in glass and have them in bad living situations. Don't support stuff like that girl. Thought you knew better."" It has not been confirmed where the pet store Selena's puppy is from gets its animals, and Selena's team has not confirmed or denied any information about the animal at this time.

","Fans are also wondering whether the dog belongs solely to Selena—who had rescued five shelter dogs as of 2010, according to People —or if Abelena are co-parenting the pooch. If it's the latter, they won't be alone: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, who have been dating since December, adopted a husky puppy together just last weekend and have already set up an Instagram account for Porky Basquiat.
